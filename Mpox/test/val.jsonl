{"id": "VAL-2", "input_field": "What tests are available?", "output_field":"PCR is the reference standard for monkeypox virus detection. Other tests, including viral culture and serology, can be performed in some laboratories, but they are not recommended for routine diagnosis."}
{"id": "VAL-3", "input_field": "When and how to provide testing or refer a patient for testing?", "output_field":"Testing is highly recommended for all people with suspected mpox infection. Pathways for testing vary according to the country and health system."}
{"id": "VAL-4", "input_field": "How do I make a diagnosis? Is one test enough?", "output_field":"A single positive PCR test is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of mpox, and testing is highly recommended for all suspected cases. Where tests are unavailable, a clinical diagnosis might rely on a patient meeting the case definition of a “suspected case”. This would be either: On the basis of contact with a probable or confirmed mpox case in the 21 days before the onset of signs or symptoms, in a person who presents with any of the following: acute onset of fever (>38.5 °C), headache, myalgia (muscle pain/body aches), back pain, profound weakness or fatigue or  On the basis of the presence of an unexplained acute skin rash (especially in locations typical for mpox), mucosal lesions or lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).  However, care should be taken to differentiate mpox from other infections which may resemble mpox, including varicella zoster (shingles), herpes zoster, measles, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, disseminated gonococcal infection, primary or secondary syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale and molluscum contagiosum, among others. Testing for co-infection including for HIV and STIs should be considered as indicated and may be considered as routine clinical practice in sexual health services, and standard local guidance should be followed."}
{"id": "VAL-5", "input_field": "How do I test a client without lesions?", "output_field":"Patients may have known contact of a probable or confirmed case in the previous 21 days without showing lesions. Look for these symptoms:acute onset of fever (>38.5°C)headacheproctitis/anal painmyalgia (muscle pain/body aches)back painswollen lymph node profound weakness or fatigue If a combination of these symptoms present without visible lesions, consider testing them using an upper respiratory (oro/nasopharyngeal) swab or an anorectal swab, particularly if anal sex may have been the exposure route.  However, the interpretation of results from oropharyngeal, anal and rectal swabs requires caution; while a positive result is indicative of mpox infection, a negative result is not enough to rule it out."}
{"id": "VAL-6", "input_field": "How can I protect myself during specimen collection?", "output_field":"To collect specimens in a safe and efficient manner, ensure you have received proper training and are familiar with the recommendations and guidelines regarding specimen collection. Interim guidance for laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus can be found  here. Vigorous swabbing of lesions can be used as a first line method for specimen collection. The use of sharp instruments carries a risk of injury and contamination and should be avoided unless appropriate safety measures are in place.  Before specimen collection, it is important to ensure that all appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) has been properly worn and fitted. In addition, it is important to communicate clearly to the patient what they should expect in terms of procedure but also discomfort. This will help avoid unexpected reactions. See  WHO’s clinical and IPC guidance for mpox for more information. If available and appropriate, you can also consider getting vaccinated, as additional protection against infection."}
{"id": "VAL-7", "input_field": "How do I encourage testing for someone who might have mpox?", "output_field":"To help encourage testing, it is important to build and maintain trust with your communities and ensure that services are free from stigma and discrimination. It should be emphasized that testing for mpox is voluntary and just one part of a package of support which includes counselling, referral for medical care and social support where available.  When individuals seek medical advice around mpox, equip them with adequate information by explaining clearly how testing works and what it entails. Understand that people may only come for testing if they have severe symptoms like pain and multiple lesions.  Helping inform at-risk communities about mpox including signs, symptoms, and how it can be passed on to others through close contact can help encourage open conversations around risks and testing. Encourage your clients to raise awareness in their communities for people with symptoms and close contacts to seek health advice."}
{"id": "VAL-8", "input_field": "How do I counsel clients about their results and next steps based on results?", "output_field":"A diagnosis of mpox can be distressing for clients, friends and family. Here are some considerations:  Providing easy to understand information about home care and medical support services can be empowering for individuals.  A positive test result should lead to referral for medical care and counselling services. Understanding what is available and how clients can access these services is important.   Follow up is important especially for people recovering at home in isolation – ensure that clients are engaged with follow up contact and support.   For negative test results it is also important to advise your client that it does not necessarily mean they are not infected. Provide them with information on how to monitor for symptoms and counsel them on retesting if appropriate."}
{"id": "VAL-9", "input_field": "When should I get tested for mpox (also known as monkeypox)?", "output_field":"If you are experiencing an unexplained skin rash or lesions inside your mouth or genital area you should seek medical care. After considering your medical history, symptoms and potential exposures, your healthcare provider will advise you on whether you need to be tested for mpox.  If you know you have been in close contact with someone else with mpox and you have symptoms, you should ask your healthcare provider to be tested. Close contact can mean face-to-face (such as talking); skin-to-skin (such as touching or anal or vaginal sex); mouth-to-mouth (such as kissing); or mouth-to-skin contact (such as oral sex). Common symptoms of mpox include rash, swollen lymph nodes, fever and body aches, but they can also be more general such as headache, fatigue and a sore throat. Some people also experience a rash or swelling around the genital area or anus or pain and inflammation of the rectum (proctitis). There is more detailed information about mpox symptoms on this   infographic1.   You should carefully monitor for symptoms if you have been in contact with someone who has mpox. You can also contact your healthcare provider who can support you as you monitor for symptoms."}
{"id": "VAL-10", "input_field": "Why should I get tested if I have mpox symptoms?", "output_field":"If you have symptoms, getting tested for mpox is important for your health and to protect people around you.  It is the first step towards making a full recovery without complications.  Knowing if you have mpox will enable you to get the right support in a timely manner. While most people with mpox recover on their own, some people will need social support, counselling and medical care which may include pain management and antibiotics. Some people have a higher risk of complications if they have mpox. This includes children, people who are pregnant and people who are immunosuppressed including some people living with HIV. It is important for anyone in these high-risk groups who  is concerned they may have mpox to seek health advice, including getting tested and, if needed, receiving the appropriate care to manage their symptoms.  Testing is also a vital tool in helping end the outbreak. If you test positive for mpox, take precautions to protect others by wearing a mask and covering your lesions. Precautions could also include a period of self-isolation until your lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath.  Depending on your local context, local health authorities may carry out contact tracing to alert contacts of possible infections while respecting your confidentiality. If we are able to stop more people from getting infected, we can end the outbreak."}
{"id": "VAL-11", "input_field": "How should I get tested if I think I have mpox?", "output_field":"Your healthcare provider can advise you on testing options in your local area if they think you may have mpox. The first step is to have a sample collected. Usually, a sample is collected by a healthcare provider, but you may be given instructions on how to collect your own sample at home.   Your sample will be sent to the laboratory to be tested and it may take a few days to receive the results. During this time your healthcare provider may also link you with support services including counselling, social support, and medical care if required.   Since testing capacity for mpox is still limited around the world, WHO is working to support countries and ensure that everyone who needs a test has access to one."}
{"id": "VAL-12", "input_field": "How should testing for mpox work?", "output_field":"First, if you are getting testing in a health facility, you should be placed in a private room or area. Your healthcare provider will be wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for sample collection.  A sample will be collected by swabbing your skin or mouth lesions and surrounding skin because lesion material is the best sample type and most likely to give an accurate test result. The healthcare provider may swab more than one of your lesions.  If you do not have lesions other sample types might be collected, including a swab from the back of your throat (oropharyngeal swab) or from your genital and anal area (genital, anal and rectal swabs).  Your healthcare provider will then send your sample to a laboratory where it will be tested for the monkeypox virus. Other possible causes of your lesions may be tested for, to arrive at a diagnosis.  Depending on your local context, the lab will either contact you directly or the results will be returned to your healthcare provider. You should be contacted to receive the result and if necessary be referred for further care."}
{"id": "VAL-13", "input_field": "What kinds of tests are available for mpox?", "output_field":"Currently, mpox testing is done using a laboratory-based technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This type of test is widely used to diagnose many types of infections. At this time, PCR tests are the only method recommended to test for mpox.  There are rapid tests in development that detect antigens (proteins) that are part of the virus. It is not known at this time how easily these antigens are detected, in which samples, or when in the course of infection they may be detected; therefore, we don’t yet know if rapid tests are accurate. Research is ongoing to understand whether and how well antigen tests can be used and with which samples. Because of this, antigen tests should not be used for testing of active infection with the monkeypox virus at this time.   The immune response following infection with monkeypox virus can be checked through antibody tests (sometimes called serological tests). As these tests do not detect the virus itself, they only indicate that you have been exposed to the virus and are not recommended as the sole test for the diagnosis of mpox. Antibody tests are mostly used for research purposes and are not widely available."}
{"id": "VAL-14", "input_field": "How accurate are the results?", "output_field":"Positive results from samples taken from lesions are generally very accurate in identifying cases of mpox. It is very unlikely you will get a positive result (false positive) if you do not have mpox.   False negative results, where the result is negative, but the individual does have mpox, are uncommon. They may happen if the sample was collected quite early or late in the course of the illness, as there may have been less virus in the sample. This means that although the test result is negative you might have mpox infection.    Results from other sample types, such as throat, genital, anal or rectal swabs, may be less accurate than samples taken from lesions, but research is ongoing to understand these better.   Generally, a positive result for these can be trusted and it means you are infected; a negative result doesn’t necessarily mean you do not have mpox, as the amount of virus in these samples may be lower and therefore infections can be missed."}
{"id": "VAL-15", "input_field": "What should I do if my test results are positive for mpox?", "output_field":"If you have a positive test result for mpox, this means you have mpox. Your healthcare provider will advise you on next steps. Take precautions to protect others by following the WHO advice for recovering from mpox at home, if this is what is recommended to you. Isolation could also be in a health care facility until your lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. This will help prevent anyone else from getting infected. Your healthcare provider will give you advice on how to take care of yourself. WHO’s public health advice   for recovering from monkeypox at home provides some useful tips. If you have had close contact (including sex) with anyone in the 21 days before your symptoms started or you tested positive, if possible, you should tell them about your diagnosis so they can monitor for symptoms of mpox and get tested if necessary.  Healthcare providers may be able to pass on information to your previous contacts anonymously if you do not feel able to share the information yourself."}
{"id": "VAL-16", "input_field": "Do I have to tell other people that I have mpox?", "output_field":"Your test results are private. Neither the laboratory nor your healthcare provider will tell anyone other than you and relevant public health authorities the results of your mpox test.   You are not obliged to tell anyone what your results are. However, letting anyone who you have been in close contact with, after the onset of symptoms know that you have mpox, can help them monitor for symptoms and get tested if required.  If it is safe for you to do without fear of stigma, discrimination or harm, then having open, non-judgmental conversations with people who you have been in close contact with since you developed symptoms can help curb transmission."}
{"id": "VAL-17", "input_field": "What is mpox (monkeypox)?", "output_field":"Mpox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus. It is a viral infection which can spread between people, mainly through close contact, and occasionally from the environment to people via things and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. In settings where the monkeypox virus is present among some wild animals, it can also be transmitted from infected animals to people who have contact with them.Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO has begun using a new preferred term “mpox” as a synonym for monkeypox. Read more on the background to this decision here."}
{"id": "VAL-18", "input_field": "What are the symptoms of mpox?", "output_field":"Mpox can cause a range of signs and symptoms. While some people have less severe symptoms, others may develop more serious illness and need care in a health facility. Common symptoms of mpox include a rash which may last for 2–4 weeks. This may start with, or be followed by, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands (lymph nodes). The rash looks like blisters or sores, and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. These lesions may also be found in the mouth, throat, anus, rectum or vagina, or on the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to several thousand. Some people develop inflammation inside the rectum (proctitis) that can cause severe pain, as well as inflammation of the genitals that may cause difficulties urinating.In most cases, the symptoms of mpox go away on their own within a few weeks with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever. However, in some people, the illness can be severe or lead to complications and even death. Newborn babies, children, people who are pregnant and people with underlying immune deficiencies such as from advanced HIV disease may be at higher risk of more serious mpox disease and death.  Severe disease due to mpox may include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood, and lung infections. Complications can include severe bacterial infection from skin lesions, mpox affecting the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia), and eye problems. People with severe mpox may require hospitalization, supportive care and antiviral medicines to reduce the severity of lesions and shorten time to recovery.According to available data, between 0.1% and 10% of people with mpox have died. It is important to note that death rates in different settings may differ due to several factors, such as access to health care and underlying immunosuppression, including because of undiagnosed HIV or advanced HIV disease."}
{"id": "VAL-19", "input_field": "How does mpox spread?", "output_field":"From person to person:Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). During the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions.People with mpox are considered infectious until all their lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath, and all the lesions on the eyes and in the body (in the mouth, throat, eyes, vagina and anus) have healed too, which usually takes from 2 to 4 weeks.It is also possible for the virus to persist for some time on clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. Someone else who touches these items may become infected, particularly if they have any cuts or abrasions or touch their eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous membranes without first washing their hands. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces/objects and cleaning your hands after touching surfaces/objects that may be contaminated can help prevent this type of transmission.The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact.  Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, there is still limited information on whether the virus can be transmitted from someone with the virus before they get symptoms or after their lesions have healed. Although live virus has been isolated from semen, we do not yet know the extent to which infection can spread through semen, vaginal fluids, amniotic fluids, breastmilk or blood.From animals to humans:Someone who comes into physical contact with an animal which carries the virus, such as some species of monkeys or a terrestrial rodent (such as the tree squirrel) may also develop mpox. Exposure by such physical contact with an animal or meat can occur through bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping or preparing a meal. The virus can also be caught through eating contaminated meat which is not cooked thoroughly.The risk of getting mpox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In countries where animals carry the virus, any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating.  From humans to animals:There have been a few reports of the virus being identified in pet dogs. However, it has not been confirmed whether these were true infections or whether the detection of virus was related to surface contamination.Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings. People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including pets (such as cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils), livestock and wildlife.More detailed advice for pet owners and persons working with animals can be found in the WOAH risk guidance on reducing spillback of monkeypox virus.WHO continues to work with its One Health partners, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), to learn more about the natural reservoir of the virus and help countries to reduce the risk of mpox transmission from or to animals."}
{"id": "VAL-20", "input_field": "Who is at risk of mpox?", "output_field":"People who have close contact with someone who has mpox are at risk of infection. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). People who have contact with clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and other surfaces that have been touched by someone with mpox are also at risk.Anyone living with someone who has mpox should take steps to reduce the risk of becoming infected. A person who has been diagnosed with mpox should be assessed by a health care provider to determine if they are well enough to be cared for at home and if isolation can be safely managed at home.Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox (by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharps such as needles)."}
{"id": "VAL-21", "input_field": "Are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men at higher risk of contracting mpox?", "output_field":"The risk of mpox is not limited to people who are sexually active or gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who has symptoms is at risk and any person with multiple sex partners is also at risk.Most of the cases that were reported in the multi-country outbreak in 2022/2023 were identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Given that the virus moves from person to person in these sexual networks in many countries, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men may be at higher risk of being exposed if they have sex or other form of close contact with someone who is infectious. People who have multiple or new sexual partners are most at risk. Engaging communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to raise awareness is essential to protect those most at risk. If you are a man who has sex with other men, know your risk and take steps to protect yourself and others. Anyone who has symptoms that could be mpox should seek advice from a health care provider immediately to get tested and get care.Sex workers and their clients are also at risk. Engaging sex worker organizations and networks to raise awareness and protect those most at risk is essential to stop mpox outbreaks. Public health advice for sex workers can be found here. Advice for managers of sex-on-premises venues can be found here."}
{"id": "VAL-22", "input_field": "How can I protect myself and others against mpox?", "output_field":"To protect yourself and others against mpox, know the signs and symptoms, how the virus spreads, what to do if you get ill, and the risk in your area or community.If the virus is spreading in your area or in your community, have open conversations with those you come into close contact with about any symptoms you or they may have. Avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox, including sexual contact. Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.If you think you might have mpox, you can act to protect others by seeking medical advice and isolating from others until you have been evaluated and tested. If you have mpox, you should isolate yourself from others until all your lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath. This will stop you from passing on the virus to others. Follow your local health authority instructions on isolation at home or in a health facility. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered.In countries where some animals have been found to carry the monkeypox virus (i.e. some countries in in east, central and west Africa), protect yourself by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). Any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating."}
{"id": "VAL-23", "input_field": "I am travelling to an mpox-affected area. What precautions should I take?", "output_field":"Before travelling, equip yourself with information about mpox, including its signs and symptoms, how it spreads, the behaviours that increase your risk of infection, and how to seek medical care at your destination.    Be aware that the country you’re visiting, as well as your own, may have specific entry requirements; inform yourself about them. Your healthcare provider will be able to discuss vaccination for mpox with you and offer advice based on an individual risk assessment.If you have been in close contact or had sex with someone with mpox or were potentially exposed to mpox through contaminated objects such as bedding or needles, follow the health advice issued by national or local health authorities. If you develop symptoms, refrain from travelling, isolate yourself, and seek medical care immediately. Should you develop symptoms after your trip, seek medical care and inform healthcare providers of your travel history and other information that may facilitate medical assessment."}
{"id": "VAL-24", "input_field": "What do we know about mpox and sex?", "output_field":"Mpox can spread through close contact of any kind, including through kissing, touching, oral and penetrative vaginal or anal sex with someone who is infectious. People who have sex with multiple or new partners are most at risk.Anyone with new and unusual rashes or lesions should avoid having sex or any other kind of close contact with other people until they have been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mpox. Remember that the rash can also be found in places that can be hard to see inside the body, including the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina and anus/anal area.If mpox is spreading through sex in your community or area, consider reducing your risk until the outbreak is brought under control by:openly communicating with partners about mpox symptoms and risks;exchanging contact details with sexual partners so that you can inform each other if you do develop symptoms;taking a break from having sex;reducing your number of new sexual partners, one off sexual partners, or anonymous sexual partners;consistently using condoms;avoiding group sex;avoiding sex-on-premises venues (such as cruising bars, saunas, darkrooms, commercial sex venues or any premises where sex is exchanged for money);avoiding using alcohol or drugs in sexual contexts (including chemsex);and, where and when available, by taking up the offer of vaccines.While the monkeypox virus has been found in semen, it is currently not known whether mpox can be spread through semen or vaginal fluids. Wearing a condom won’t fully protect you from mpox, but it may reduce your risk or extent of exposure and it will help protect you and others from HIV and a range of other STIs. People with mpox are advised to use condoms for 12 weeks after they recover.For more information on the risk of mpox and sex, please see the public health advice for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, public health advice for sex workers on mpox, and public health advice on mpox and sex-on-premises venues and events."}
{"id": "VAL-25", "input_field": "I have mpox. What can I do to protect other people from getting infected?", "output_field":"If you have mpox, your healthcare provider will advise you on what to do while you recover. Follow national advice on whether you should recover at home or if you need care in a health facility.In the meantime, it is important to avoid having close contact with others until your lesions have completely healed.If you are advised to isolate at home, protect those you live with as much as possible by:asking friends and family to help you by delivering things you need;isolating in a separate room;using a separate bathroom, or cleaning any surfaces you touched after each use;cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces with soap and water and a household disinfectant;avoiding sweeping/vacuuming (this might disturb virus particles and cause others to become infected);using separate utensils, objects, electronics, or clean well with soap and water/disinfectant before sharing;not sharing towels, bedding or clothes;doing your own laundry (lift bedding, clothes and towels carefully without shaking them, put materials in a plastic bag before carrying it to the washing machine and wash them with hot water over 60 degrees Celsius);opening windows for good ventilation; andencouraging everyone in the house to clean their hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.If you cannot avoid being in the same room as someone else or having close contact with another person while isolating at home, then do your best to limit their risk by:avoiding touching each other;cleaning your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer;covering your rash with clothing or bandages (until you can isolate again – your rash will heal best if uncovered);opening windows throughout the home;ensuring you and anyone in the room with you wear well-fitting medical masks; andmaintaining at least 1 metre of distance from others.If you cannot do your own laundry and someone else needs to do it for you, they should wear a well-fitting medical mask, disposable gloves and take the laundry precautions listed above."}
{"id": "VAL-26", "input_field": "What care does someone with mpox need to recover fully?", "output_field":"The care someone needs will depend on their symptoms and their risk of developing more severe disease. People with mpox should follow the advice of their health care provider. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever (such as analgesics and antipyretics).It is important for anyone with mpox who is recovering at home to stay hydrated, eat well and get enough sleep. People who are self-isolating should take care of their mental health by doing things they find relaxing and enjoyable, staying connected to loved ones using technology, exercising if they feel well enough and can do so while isolating, and asking for support with their mental health if they need it.People with mpox should avoid scratching their skin and take care of their rash by cleaning their hands before and after touching lesions and keeping skin dry and uncovered (unless they are unavoidably in a room with someone else, in which case they should cover it with clothing or a bandage until they are able to isolate again). The rash can be kept clean with sterilized water or antiseptic. Saltwater rinses can be used for sores in the mouth, and warm baths with baking soda and Epsom salts can ease the discomfort of sores on the body. Paracetamol can be used to help manage the pain caused by lesions, if needed. If stronger pain medicine is needed, advice should be sought from a health care provider.See this infographic on recovering from mpox at home for some helpful tips."}
{"id": "VAL-27", "input_field": "Why does stigma related to mpox matter?", "output_field":"When there is stigma or discrimination related to a medical condition, people may not seek care quickly, the quality of health care may suffer, and access to health services for the most vulnerable is reduced.It is possible to prevent or reduce stigma and discrimination related to mpox through strategies to offer stigma-free care, employ non-stigmatizing language, support people in seeking health care and create an enabling environment where the best quality of care is available.Read more here on how to address stigma and discrimination related to mpox."}
{"id": "VAL-28", "input_field": "What should I do if a child in my care has mpox?", "output_field":"Children can catch mpox if they have close contact with someone who has symptoms. Children can be exposed to the virus at home from siblings, parents, caregivers, or other family members through close contact. In some settings in Africa, children and adolescents may be exposed through hunting or trapping activities or consumption of insufficiently cooked meat. Adolescents who have engaged in sexual activity with someone with mpox can also be exposed. The mpox rash can at first resemble other common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and other viral infections. If a child you are caring for has symptoms that could be mpox, seek advice from a healthcare provider. They will help to get them tested, and to access the care they need.Children may be at greater risk of severe mpox than adults. They should be closely monitored until they have recovered in case they need additional care. A health worker responsible for the child may advise that they are cared for in a health facility. In this situation, a parent or caregiver who is healthy and at low risk of mpox will be allowed to stay with them.If you have confirmed or suspected mpox and you are breastfeeding, talk to your healthcare provider for advice. They will assess the risk of transmitting mpox as well as the risk of withholding breastfeeding from your infant. If it is possible for you to continue to breastfeed and have close contact, they will advise you on how to reduce the risk by taking other measures, including covering up lesions. The risk of infection will need to be carefully balanced with the potential harm and distress caused by interrupting breastfeeding and close contact between parent and child. It is not yet known whether the monkeypox virus can be spread from parent to child through breastmilk; this is an area in need of further study."}
{"id": "VAL-29", "input_field": "Is there a treatment for mpox?", "output_field":"Many years of research on therapeutics for smallpox have led to the development of products that may also be useful for treating mpox. For example, an antiviral developed to treat smallpox (tecovirimat) was approved in January 2022 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of mpox under exceptional circumstances. Experience with these therapeutics in the context of an outbreak of mpox is growing but still limited. For this reason, their use is usually accompanied by enrolment in a clinical trial or expanded access protocol accompanied by the collection of information that will improve knowledge on how best to use them in future."}
{"id": "VAL-30", "input_field": "Are people who are immunosuppressed at higher risk of developing severe mpox (including people living with HIV)?", "output_field":"Persons with immune suppression are at higher risk of developing severe mpox or dying. Severe mpox can include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), conditions such as inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs, or secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections.People with advanced HIV disease (late presentation, low CD4 count and high HIV viral load) have an elevated risk of death if they develop severe mpox. This is more common in people with HIV status unknown prior to a diagnosis of mpox.People living with HIV who achieve viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment do not appear to be at any higher risk of severe mpox than the general population. Use of daily effective HIV treatment (antiretrovirals or ARVs) reduces the risk of developing severe mpox symptoms in the case of infection. People with untreated HIV and advanced HIV disease may be immunocompromised and therefore be at greater risk of severe mpox. WHO advises countries to integrate HIV and mpox testing, prevention and care.People who are sexually active and who do not know their HIV status are advised to seek a test for HIV. People living with HIV on effective treatment have the same life expectancy as their HIV negative peers.Severe mpox cases seen in some countries highlight the urgent need to increase equitable access to mpox diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics, and to HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Without this, most affected groups are being left without the tools they need to protect their sexual health and well-being.If you are living with HIV, continue to take your HIV medication as directed. If you think you may have mpox, seek medical advice.If you think you are at risk for mpox or have been diagnosed with mpox, you may benefit from testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you don’t know your HIV status, ask your health worker for an HIV test. This will help your health care provider to ensure you receive the best possible care. In 2023 there were 9 million people in the world living with HIV but not on HIV treatment and who could be at risk for advanced HIV disease – 5 million of whom were living in Africa."}
{"id": "VAL-31", "input_field": "Is there a vaccine against mpox?", "output_field":"Yes, there are vaccines recommended by WHO for use against mpox. Many years of research led to the development of newer and safer vaccines for smallpox (which no longer exists as it was eradicated) and mpox. At present, WHO recommends use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines for people at risk during an outbreak of mpox. ACAM2000 may also be used for certain people based on an individual assessment when other vaccines are not available."}
{"id": "VAL-32", "input_field": "Should I get vaccinated for mpox?", "output_field":"Mpox vaccines provide protection against infection and severe disease. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether you should get vaccinated. This will depend on your individual risk as well as the availability of vaccines in your area. WHO recommends vaccination for people at high risk of exposure to mpox during an outbreak, such as health workers or people who have been in contact with someone with mpox. During outbreaks, WHO also recommends vaccination for children at high risk of exposure.Travellers who may be at risk, based on an individual risk assessment with their healthcare provider, may wish to consider vaccination.Whether vaccinated or not, continue to take care to avoid catching and spreading mpox. This is because it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated and because a few people may not fully respond to vaccination. For those who acquire mpox after vaccination, the vaccine still protects against severe disease and hospitalization."}
{"id": "VAL-33", "input_field": "What are the risks of mpox during pregnancy?", "output_field":"Contracting mpox during pregnancy (which is considered a relative immunosuppressed state) can be dangerous for the fetus or newborn infant and can lead to loss of the pregnancy, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or complications for the parent. If you are pregnant, avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious can get mpox, regardless of who they are. If you think you have been exposed to or are showing symptoms that could be mpox, contact your healthcare provider. They will help you get tested and access the care you need."}
{"id": "VAL-34", "input_field": "Can I get mpox during social events, parties or other gatherings? How can I reduce my risk?", "output_field":"Anyone attending a gathering is at risk of contracting mpox if they come into close contact with someone with mpox. Mpox can spread through skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and by being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). Mpox can also spread through contact with contaminated materials or objects such as sheets or needles. Crowded gatherings where people are close together, or where people spend an extended time together in a closed space, carry more risk.To reduce the risk of transmission at gatherings, avoid close contact, including sexual contact, with anyone showing symptoms of mpox. If you develop symptoms isolate yourself, ensuring you avoid any close contact with others, and seek professional medical advice. Consider vaccination if you are at high risk of exposure, based on a healthcare provider's recommendation."}
{"id": "VAL-35", "input_field": "I’ve had mpox in the past. Can I catch it again?", "output_field":"Our understanding of how long immunity following mpox lasts continues to evolve. There have been some cases of second infections reported. A few people may get mpox despite having had it before. Even if you have had mpox in the past, you should be doing everything you can to avoid getting re-infected. If you have had mpox in the past and someone in your household has it now, you can protect others by being the designated caregiver, as you are more likely to have some immunity than others. However, you should still take all precautions to avoid exposure as far as possible."}
{"id": "VAL-36", "input_field": "What are the different virus clades and how do they differ in impact?", "output_field":"There are two broad clades of the virus: clade I and II. Clade II was behind the global mpox outbreak that began in 2022.The current understanding is that clade I leads to more severe disease and death than clade II in the populations where it is endemic. However, differences in the features of past outbreaks such as population groups affected make it hard to draw a firm conclusion. Public health advice from WHO applies for prevention and management of mpox arising from either clade.A new offshoot of clade I virus, called clade Ib, was first reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023, and has been spreading through sex and other types of close contact. Studies are underway to understand the properties of this new strain."}
