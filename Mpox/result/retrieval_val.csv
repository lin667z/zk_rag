Why does stigma related to mpox matter?,"page_content='Stigma and discrimination for any disease are never acceptable. Stigma linked to mpox can undermine public health efforts or prolong a disease outbreak, as people may be more reluctant to come forward and seek care and treatment. For mpox, stigma, discrimination and racism have been particularly directed against communities initially most affected by the disease, namely men who have sex with men, trans people and gender diverse communities.' metadata={'content': 'Stigma and discrimination'}","page_content='Avoiding and addressing stigma and discrimination: 
An outbreak of a viral infection in a community can be distressing. If cases present in your 
facility, react without being judgmental or making any assumptions about the circumstances 
regarding the infections. 
Stigma negatively affects those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, family, friends, 
and communities. Stigma and discrimination related to mpox may intersect with existing 
stigma and discrimination linked to other factors in congregate settings such as ethnicity, race, 
or sexuality. 
It may be helpful to train your staff on mpox, stigma and discrimination to encourage 
adherence to proposed public health measures aimed at protecting your whole community. 
Understanding existing patterns and identifying things that have worked in the past to reduce 
stigma and discrimination will be useful. 
Key points for consideration:

Stigma associated with monkeypox may be 
associated with the following factors: 
•	 Monkeypox is being found in new places and 
possibly spreading in new ways. There are still 
many unknowns, which fuels fear. Fear of the 
unknown often increases feelings of anxiety 
and may fuel a desire to assign blame or 
responsibility to others. 
•	 Many people have existing unconscious biases 
around race and sexual behaviour which can 
unintentionally fuel stigma and discrimination. 
•	 Some people with important contributions 
to addressing monkeypox, including health 
workers, may avoid engaging for fear of 
association with the disease and those most 
impacted.
•	 Monkeypox offers further opportunities for 
those already focused on hate, racism and 
homophobia. Some communities may already 
be subject to racism, societal perceptions and 
judgmental attitudes about sexual orientation 
and gender norms. 
•	 The monkeypox outbreak is occurring while the 
world is still coming to terms with the' metadata={'content': '（3）'}"
What should I do if a child in my care has mpox?,"page_content='Pediatric inpatient care For children hospitalized with suspected or confirmed mpox, isolation and infection control procedures should take into consideration the child's age and caregiving needs, family and caregiver preferences, and individual patient and caregiver factors, including the patient's course of illness, the extent and location of lesions, the ability to cover lesions, and the risk to caregivers (e.g., pregnant or immunocompromised people). The presence of caregivers in the hospital provides immeasurable benefit to children. In homes Isolation and infection control measures  can prevent the spread of mpox to others. Extra care should be taken to ensure all children avoid close contact with people who have mpox.

PEP with the JYNNEOS vaccine should be considered for the uninfected caregiver. Early bathing is recommended for neonates born to individuals with suspected, probable, or confirmed mpox. Bathing can be performed using soap and water and should occur prior to the neonate receiving procedures, vaccines, and medications (e.g., Vitamin K).
