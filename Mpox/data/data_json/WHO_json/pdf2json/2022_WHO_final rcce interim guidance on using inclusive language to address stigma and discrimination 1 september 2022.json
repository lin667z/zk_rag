Anyone who has close \ncontact with someone who is infectious is at risk. \nOutbreaks of monkeypox in newly affected \ncountries have mostly been identified in communities \nof gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with \nmen who have had recent sexual contact with a \nnew partner or partners. Communities of trans and \ngender diverse people linked to the same sexual \nnetworks have also been affected. \nWhile the risk is not limited to these groups, the \noutbreak has become an additional focus for stigma \nand discrimination directed against men who have \nsex with men, trans people and broader lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex communities \nand their families. Similarly, stigma, discrimination \nand other expressions of racism towards \ncommunities from previously affected regions \nhas increased as a result of the new outbreak of \nmonkeypox.\nStigma and discrimination connected to any \ndisease, including monkeypox, are never \nacceptable. They can have a serious impact on \nhealth outcomes and undermine the outbreak \nresponse by making people reluctant to come \nforward or seek care. This increases the risk of \ntransmission – both within the most affected \ncommunities and beyond.  \nThe impact of stigma and discrimination on \nthe monkeypox outbreak must be mitigated \nthrough active strategies to prevent people \nbeing unable or unwilling to access health \nservices and support and to create an enabling \nenvironment where people feel able to report \ntheir symptoms. \nThis public health advice from WHO provides information on the potential impact of stigma, \nrecommended language and actions to counter stigmatizing attitudes and discriminatory \nbehaviours and policies related to the monkeypox outbreak. It will be updated as more is known \nabout effective strategies against stigma and discrimination in the context of this outbreak. \n1 September 2022\nA note before we start \nPeople often stigmatize others without being \naware that they’re doing it, and without any \nmalicious intent. People automatically make \njudgments about others without realizing how \nit might affect them. In fact, most people have \nfelt ostracized or been treated like a minority \nat some time in their lives. We all find ourselves \nperpetuating harmful stereotypes or falling back \non unconscious biases at times. Being aware of \none's own unconscious bias is important, but even \nmore important is to not allow those implicit biases \nto cause discrimination to be enabled or ignored.\nProactively reflecting and acting on our own \nlanguage, behaviour and intentions as individuals \nand as agencies is essential to reducing the \nharm caused by stigma and discrimination. \nHaving good intentions is not enough – this \ninterim guidance is for everyone working on or \nconcerned by monkeypox. Fear of perpetuating \nstigma and discrimination should not stop \nindividuals and organizations from speaking up \non important issues; the most important thing we \ncan do is to be reflective, seek feedback, call out \nstigma and discrimination where we see it and be \nopen to learning and changing our behaviour."

Stigma is often fueled by fear or anxiety, \nbut stigmatizing language can also be used by \npeople accidentally with no bad intentions due to a \nlack of awareness. Discrimination is the behaviours \nthat result from stigmatizing attitudes or beliefs. \nPeople who are stigmatized may be rejected, \nstereotyped, discriminated against, abused and/\nor experience violence directed at them because \nof a perceived or real link with the disease. Stigma \n- or fear of stigma - negatively affects those with \nthe disease. People who don’t have the disease \nbut share other characteristics with those who \ndo may also experience stigma. Some people, \nincluding families or friends, may be stigmatized \nby their association with a group or community \nthat is stigmatized. Health workers may also face \ndiscrimination or stigmatizing attitudes for their work \nwith affected populations. \nPeople who have been systemically and historically \nmarginalized may experience a disproportionately \nhigher amount of stigma than the majority \npopulation. Stigma can be associated with historical \nand religious attitudes and perceptions toward \ncertain groups.  \nLayered or intersectional stigma occurs when a \ngroup that is already marginalized for one reason is \nadditionally marginalized when they are identified \nwith a different stigmatized group or factor. For \nexample, someone who uses drugs or alcohol in a \nharmful way may be stigmatized for their substance \nuse and further stigmatized if they are perceived by \nothers as having a connection to other health issues.  \nWhat do stigma and \ndiscrimination look like in \npractice?\nStigma can take many forms, including:\n•\t Stereotyping \n•\t Negative attitudes \n•\t Hostility \n•\t Judgement \n•\t Perceptions that the individual(s) ‘cause’ or \n‘deserve’ bad things\n•\t Negative portrayals in popular culture, the \nmedia or public discourse  \nExamples of discrimination include: \n•\t Policies, services and opportunities that exclude \nor miss certain people \n•\t Isolating some groups of people from others\n•\t Hostile behaviour \n•\t Hate speech \n•\t Using harmful, mocking or derogatory \nlanguage \n•\t Harassment \n•\t Violence \n•\t Bullying \nStigma and discrimination  \nin the current outbreak  \nof monkeypox\nThe current monkeypox outbreak has provoked \nstigma and discriminatory behaviours and language \nagainst people from countries where monkeypox \nhas been found in the past in West and Central \nAfrica, and against gay, bisexual and other men \nwho have sex with men and trans and gender \ndiverse people in all regions, as well as against \nothers who have or who are perceived to have \nbeen in contact with someone who has contracted \nmonkeypox."

There are still \nmany unknowns, which fuels fear. Fear of the \nunknown often increases feelings of anxiety \nand may fuel a desire to assign blame or \nresponsibility to others. \n•\t Many people have existing unconscious biases \naround race and sexual behaviour which can \nunintentionally fuel stigma and discrimination. \n•\t Some people with important contributions \nto addressing monkeypox, including health \nworkers, may avoid engaging for fear of \nassociation with the disease and those most \nimpacted.\n•\t Monkeypox offers further opportunities for \nthose already focused on hate, racism and \nhomophobia. Some communities may already \nbe subject to racism, societal perceptions and \njudgmental attitudes about sexual orientation \nand gender norms. \n•\t The monkeypox outbreak is occurring while the \nworld is still coming to terms with the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic and associated \nresponses. It is understandable that people feel \nconfusion, anxiety, and fear about a disease, \nespecially if they are learning about it for the \nfirst time, but it is important not to let fear fuel \nharmful stereotypes.\nGender, language  \nand health\nGender norms, roles and relations, and gender \ninequality and inequity, affect people’s health \nall around the world. Gender-related barriers to \nhealthcare are a reality experienced by many in \nLGBTQI+ communities. That is why awareness of \nand considered use of community-appropriate \nlanguage is crucial.\nFor more information on the links between gender \nand health and key terminology, please see WHO’s \nGender and health Q&A. \nApproaches for \nunderstanding, \npreventing and \naddressing stigma \nand discrimination\nWhile stigma may not be able to be “fixed” \novernight, organizations, communities and \nindividuals can help to push back and address \nstigma, given a safe environment to do so.\nThe approaches listed propose key strategies \nand approaches that can be used to understand, \nprevent and address stigma and discrimination in \ndifferent contexts. The most impactful approaches \nwill always be driven by the context, actors, \nthose affected, and other local factors. Consulting \nwith affected communities should be prioritized \nin all contexts to identify best practices and key \nchallenges. \nReview your own attitudes, \nbehaviours, organizations and \npolicies for unconscious bias, \nstigma and discrimination \nAvoid the assumption that your positive intentions \nmake you exempt from perpetrating stigma \nand discrimination. Examine your individual \nor organizational approach to monkeypox to \nidentify any of the issues above. Ask for feedback \nfrom affected populations. Ensure that any \ndocuments, strategies or plans take a proactive \napproach to tackling stigma and discrimination \nand ensuring equitable programmes for those \nmost at risk. Within organizations, drawing on \nexisting documents outlining the consequences \nfor stigma, discrimination, harassment and other \nforms of negative behaviour can be helpful. \nGiven that many forms of stigma are unconscious \nor unintentional, it can be helpful to create an \nenvironment in which people are willing and able \nto examine and change their own unconscious \nbiases without fear of judgment, and to learn from \nmistakes."

Affected \ncommunities should be consulted to understand \nwhat they are experiencing. Establishing or drawing \non existing feedback systems, monitoring online and \noffline discourse and holding community dialogues \ncan be ways to gather data to inform activities. \nDraw on empathy\nEmpathy is the ability to understand and share other \npeople’s feelings. Using empathy can help people \nto understand how painful it is to be stigmatized, \nshamed or rejected. \nHow we communicate about monkeypox is critical \nin supporting people to take effective action to \nhelp combat the disease and to avoid fueling \nfear and stigma. An environment needs to be \ncreated in which the disease and its impact can \nbe discussed and addressed openly, honestly \nand effectively.  Remember empathy rather than \nsympathy helps ensure the dignity of people \naffected by monkeypox. Empathetic communication \nplaces more emphasis on listening than talking, \ndemonstrating understanding, and acknowledging \nthe hardships that people are facing. \nSpread the facts\nStigma can be heightened by a lack of \nunderstanding about how monkeypox is transmitted \nand treated, and how to prevent infection. Share \nclear, simple, transparent and accurate country- \nand community-specific information about the \noutbreak, treatment options, vaccination and where \nto access healthcare and information. \nEngage social influencers\nLeading trusted voices can inform people about \nmonkeypox and help increase awareness of \nthe dangers of stigma. Influencers can urge \npeople to recognize and avoid stigma and \namplify messages that reduce discrimination \nand judgment.  Influencers who are asked to \ncommunicate information about monkeypox (or \nany other disease) must be personally engaged, \nand geographically and culturally aligned with the \naudiences they seek to influence. Due diligence \nshould be carried out before engaging with \ninfluencers to ensure that they will not contribute \ntowards stigma of any group of people. \nAmplify voices, stories and \nimages of people who have \nexperienced monkeypox, stigma \nor discrimination\nFirst-person stories and images help others relate \nto unfamiliar situations and circumstances. This \ncan help humanize people who have the disease \nand reassure them that most people who contract \nmonkeypox recover fully on their own.  It can also \nhelp to share stories of the negative impact of stigma \nand discrimination, and what people have done to \naddress them. \nPortray diverse people \nAnyone can contract monkeypox. Make sure you \nportray the range of different people who may be \naffected by the disease. All materials should show \ndiverse people (e.g., race, gender expression, age) \nbeing impacted and working together to prevent \nthe spread of monkeypox. Ensure that typeface, \nsymbols, images and formats are neutral and don’t \nsuggest any particular group."

Negative reporting \nhas the potential to influence the perception and \ntreatment of people who have or are suspected to \nhave monkeypox and their families and affected \ncommunities. \n•\t Ensure that media outlets are provided with \naccurate information and guidance about \nmonkeypox and encouraged to integrate non-\njudgmental language into their reporting.\n•\t Be aware that journalistic reporting which \noverly focuses on individual behavior or \nassigns blame may increase stigma towards \npeople who may have the disease or who \nmay be part of a community that is incorrectly \nblamed or perceived as being responsible for \nits spread. \nConsiderations for \ndifferent operational \nactors, partners and \nstakeholders\nHealth systems  \nand health workers \nHealth facilities are often the first point of care for \npeople with symptoms that could be monkeypox. \nIt is important to ensure that health workers \nunderstand and use appropriate terminology and \nlanguage to ensure that people feel comfortable \nand respected while accessing care. This includes \nmaking healthcare facilities welcoming and \nnonjudgmental places, where people can trust that \ntheir privacy and confidentiality will be respected. \nPeople seeking care at health facilities for \nany reason should be treated with kindness, \nconfidentiality and respect by health workers \nand other support in health facilities staff alike. \nStigmatizing attitudes (such as vocal or implied \ndisapproval of identities or behaviours) and \ndiscriminatory treatment (such as refusing to treat \npeople; testing or treating them without their \nconsent and/or sharing unauthorized personal \ndata) undermines trust and increases the likelihood \nthat people will avoid seeking care. \nDiscrimination can arise unintentionally through \nthe way in which health systems and processes \nare designed and delivered. Understanding and \naddressing the needs and concerns of all staff \nworking in health facilities is key to enabling the \nhealth workforce to deliver efficient, person-\ncentered care. \nThis includes all health workers being aware of \ntheir own unconscious biases and judgments too, \nand adjusting their day-to-day actions to minimize \nunintentional discrimination during interactions \nwith patients. For example, delaying or avoiding \nattending to the needs of certain population \ngroups, or wearing excessive PPE in situations not \nrequiring it are subtle reminders that we may be \nstigmatizing people without realizing it.\nHealth workers have an important role to \nplay speaking out in their communities to raise \nawareness and address stigma. Ensure that health \nworkers are properly supported and trained to \nrecognize stigma and have the support structures \nneeded to take steps that can address and avoid \nit. \nTraining in interpersonal communication and the \nimportance of avoiding stigmatizing language \nand discriminatory behaviours should be \nimplemented in health facilities with all staff. \nAppropriate policies should be in place to deal \nwith discriminatory behaviours. Feedback systems \ncan be established to provide people with \nopportunities to report stigma and discrimination in \nhealth facilities, with measures in place to ensure \naction is taken and feedback is provided."

Organizations working with the media \ncan hold events and information sessions to discuss \nmodes of communicating around this outbreak \nto reduce the risk of stigmatizing language being \nused. \nContact tracing \nStigma and discrimination can have a negative \nimpact on people’s willingness to report symptoms \nand share information about their contacts. People \nmay not want to be associated with the idea of \npossible sexual transmission, or they may not \nwish to disclose their sexual orientation or sexual \nhistories. People who conduct contact tracing \nshould ensure that confidentiality is respected \nand privacy measures are in place. For example, \nensure that interviews with people seeking care \ntake place in a setting where others cannot \noverhear what’s being said. \nLikewise, people who conduct contact tracing \nshould avoid asking patients to elaborate on \nthe specific nature of their contacts’ possible \nexposures. Stigma or fear of stigma may make \npeople reluctant to disclose contacts, which can \nfurther hinder efforts to slow the spread of disease. \nContact tracers should encourage people to \nprivately notify their contacts and sexual partners \nand encourage them to reach out to public health \nauthorities directly for testing and/or care.\nReferences:\nWHO.
