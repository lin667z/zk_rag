The \nnumber of cases reported at the global level peaked in August 2022, followed by a steady decline until \nApril 2023 and a smaller increase in cases from June-November 2023. The WHO regions with the most \nreported laboratory-confirmed cases are the Region of the Americas and the European Region, \nfollowed by the Western Pacific and African regions.  \n• The overall goal of continued mpox surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing is to detect \nnew outbreaks and stop transmission in order to contain the global outbreak, protect people at risk in \nendemic and new settings, and make progress towards elimination of human-to-human transmission. \n• The key objectives of surveillance and case investigation for mpox are to: rapidly identify cases and \nclusters in order to provide optimal clinical care; isolate cases to prevent further transmission; identify, \nmanage, and follow up contacts to recognize early signs of infection; identify risk groups for infection \nand for severe disease; protect frontline health workers; and tailor effective control and prevention \nmeasures. \n• Key actions of the response to the outbreak include informing those who may be most at risk for mpox \nwith accurate information; offering pre- and post-exposure vaccination to individuals at risk; stopping \nfurther spread; and protecting vulnerable individuals and frontline workers. \n• Clinicians should report suspected cases immediately to relevant public health authorities. \n• Probable and confirmed cases of mpox should be reported to WHO through IHR national focal points \n(NFPs) as early as possible, at least once monthly, including a minimum dataset of epidemiologically \nrelevant information, in line with Article 6 of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the \nmpox standing recommendations issued by the Director-General of WHO (August 2023). In areas \nwhere mpox is endemic, presumed or suspected cases that meet the national case definition (i.e., \ncases that are clinically compatible) should also be reported to WHO. \n• If mpox is suspected, case investigation should consist of a clinical examination of the patient in a well-\nventilated room while using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), questioning the patient \nabout possible sources of exposure, and safe collection and dispatch of specimens for laboratory \nmonkeypox virus (MPXV) examination. \n• As soon as a suspected case is identified, contact identification and contact tracing should be initiated. \n• Contacts of probable and confirmed cases should be monitored, or should self-monitor, daily for any \nsign or symptom for a period of 21 days from last contact with an infectious case or potentially \ncontaminated materials. \n• Quarantine or exclusion from work is not necessary during the contact monitoring period as long as \nno signs or symptoms develop. WHO encourages contacts to rigorously practice hand hygiene and \nrespiratory etiquette, avoid contact with persons who are immunocompromised or pregnant, avoid or \nminimize contact with children, and avoid sexual contact with others throughout the 21-day \nmonitoring period. Non-essential travel is discouraged during this period."

After the fifth meeting of the Emergency Committee for the multi-\ncountry outbreak of mpox on 10 May 2023, the Director-General of WHO concurred with the Emergency \nCommittee advice that the multi-country outbreak of mpox no longer continued to constitute a Public Health \nEmergency of International concern (PHEIC). Under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), a \nReview Committee was convened and advised on standing recommendations for mpox. These were issued \nby the Director-General on 21 August 2023.1 \nThe interim guidance has been updated to align with the updated reporting procedures following the \nissuance of the standing recommendations and includes the most recent information available on mpox.2–4 \nThe document contains a new chapter on mpox reinfection and provides reinfection definitions. It has also \nbeen adapted to include more considerations relevant to endemic contexts in the African region.  \nIntroduction \nThis guidance serves to provide interim recommendations for surveillance, case investigation and contact \ntracing for mpox in the context of the current global multi-country outbreak.2 \nMpox is the disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), historically found in forested areas of East, \nCentral and West Africa, where humans and animals have been infected. Since May 2022, a global outbreak \nhas been ongoing in which the number of mpox cases reported globally rose steadily until the peak in August \n2022, followed by a steady decline until April 2023. Since June 2023, there has been a smaller increase in \ncases, involving more the Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions, as well as Europe and the Americas.4 \nIn 2022-23, 117 countries reported mpox cases for the first time, with human-to-human transmission \ncontinuing for several months. This is the first time that sustained community transmission of MPXV has \noccurred outside of previously known affected areas of Africa. During this period, in central Africa the number \nof reported suspected (clinically compatible) cases has continued to rise steeply in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo with the largest number of cases ever reported. Cases are linked to clade I MPXV (formerly \nCongo Basin clade).5 \nThe incubation period of mpox generally ranges from 2 to 21 days, with shorter or longer periods occasionally \nnoted.2 During the 2022-23 outbreak, shorter incubation periods have been observed than previously \nreported.6–9 The shorter incubation period could be due to various factors, including differences in the virus \nstrains, methods of data collection, and patient demographics. Typically, the prodromal phase of clinical \nillness lasts 1-5 days, during which time patients may experience fever, headache, back pain, myalgias, and \nlymphadenopathy. This is followed by a second phase which typically occurs after the fever subsides, with \nthe appearance of skin and/or mucosal rash, which might include a single or multiple lesions. Typically, the \nlesions progress through macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules, before crusting over and desquamating \nover a period of two to four weeks. In the context of the global outbreak due to clade IIb MPXV, patients are \npresenting with more mucosal lesions than previously described, and often these are localized in the genital \nor perineal/perianal area as well as in the mouth and on the eyes.10 Lesions might appear at different stages \nof progression, and it has been observed that the rash can develop prior to typical prodromal or \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever or fatigue). Ano-rectal pain and bleeding (e.g., due to proctitis) has \nalso been reported more often in the global outbreak than previously. Lymphadenopathy remains a common \nfeature, usually appearing early in the course of illness."

                "page_content": "Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for mpox (monkeypox): Interim guidance \n- 3 - \nHuman-to-human transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious lesions of the skin \nor mucous membranes or body fluids from those lesions. This includes face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-\nmouth or mouth-to-skin contact and respiratory droplets. Exposure to short-range aerosols through \nprolonged close contact (e.g., with persons who have mpox with respiratory symptoms) may also represent \na risk factor for infection. For respiratory transmission, close proximity and extended exposure may be \nnecessary. The MPXV can enter the body through broken skin, mucosal surfaces (e. g. oral, pharyngeal, ocular, \ngenital or anal), or via the respiratory tract. The infectious period can vary, but generally patients are \nconsidered infectious from the time of symptom onset until skin lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen \noff and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. Studies have also suggested that transmission can occur \nbefore symptom onset, and emerging evidence continues to be monitored.11–14 Transmission can also occur \nfrom the environment to humans from contaminated clothing or linens that have infectious skin particles \n(also described as fomite transmission). If shaken, these particles can disperse into the air and be inhaled or \nland on broken skin or mucosal membranes, and lead to transmission and infection.15,16  \nWhile sexual transmission of mpox was not well understood before this outbreak, the detection of virus in \nsemen and anal swabs of affected patients,10,17–20  as well as epidemiological reporting of sexual contact \namong cases, have clarified that mpox caused by clade IIb MPXV is readily transmissible through sexual \nactivity. In 2023, sexual transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV has also been documented in sex workers, \namong men who have sex with men and in women exposed heterosexually in the household,5 illustrating the \nrange of sexual networks in which mpox can spread. \nDuring pregnancy, virus can cross the placenta, causing intrauterine exposure of the fetus, complications \nsuch as fetal loss or stillbirth, and congenital infection of the infant.21   \nThe sudden appearance of mpox in many countries simultaneously, where this disease was not previously \nreported or where in recent years there have only been cases linked to travel, was unexpected. Transmission, \ninitially amplified by travel and gatherings in several countries, has been sustained mainly through sexual \ncontact among gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, gender diverse persons and sex \nworkers. These key populations represent those at highest risk of exposure globally, while in African settings \nwhere mpox is endemic, children continue to be at risk as well as adults.  \nTransmission dynamics are not fully elucidated in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nwhere the virus has been increasingly circulating in recent years, Nigeria, where cases continue to occur or \nSudan, where clade I MPXV was newly reported in 2022. Recent observations suggest that MPXV in these \nsettings is widely transmitted through human-to-human contact, including sexual and non-sexual contact.5 \nWhile mpox has long been considered a zoonotic disease, confirmation of different modes of animal-to-\nhuman transmission remains elusive, which continues to limit the ability to design effective interventions. In \nsuch settings, human-to-human transmission is rising and posing a new threat to neighbouring countries.  \nThe MPXV that has been circulating in newly affected countries during the global outbreak belongs to clade \nIIb. Most of the cases belonged to lineage B of clade IIb; sporadic cases of lineage A and C have also been \nreported.4 Genomic analysis has linked the strains circulating in the multi-country outbreak to the outbreak \nwhich began in Nigeria likely in 2017.22,23 This is the largest mpox outbreak due to clade II MPXV ever recorded, \nand although most cases were among adult men, women and children have also been affected.4 In addition, \nnewly emerging outbreaks due to clade I MPXV are being detected in areas where mpox had not previously \nbeen documented, such as in various provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan.5,24"

WHO \ninterim guidance for clinical management and infection prevention and control for mpox has been published \nseparately.15 \nMPXV reinfection – Case definition \nThe global outbreak of mpox caused by clade IIb MPXV and ongoing since 2022 is the largest mpox outbreak \nto date and has resulted in transmission occurring in 117 countries, extending beyond historically affected \nregions in East, West and Central Africa. The duration of immunity following primary MPXV infection and \nsubsequent protection against reinfection were not known prior to the Clade IIb-related outbreak and \ncontinue to be poorly understood. 33 A few case reports and case series have presented instances where \nindividuals previously diagnosed with PCR-confirmed MPXV infection developed the disease and tested PCR-\npositive for MPXV for a second time.34–42 It is currently unclear whether these episodes represent new \ninfections following clinical recovery and the apparent clearance of the virus, a recrudescence of a latent \nprior infection, or lack of complete viral clearance. Genetic analysis identifying specific viral variants may \ndistinguish a reinfection from recrudescent infection. However, in practice, genomic sequencing is not \ncommonly performed due to limited capacity for genomic sequencing analysis in certain settings, technical \nconstraints stemming from the possible low viral load in subsequent mpox episodes, and difficulties in \nsequence data interpretation for reinfection determination due to generally slow viral mutation.38,39,42 \nA lack of consensus on the definition of MPXV reinfection complicates the comparison of reported cases and \nthe compilation of evidence to reach a better understanding to accurately characterize the burden, natural \nhistory, clinical characteristics and capacity for onward transmission associated with MPXV reinfection.33 \nAdditionally, in locations where access to MPXV PCR testing is constrained, a significant number of clinically \ncompatible mpox cases that meet national case definitions remain classified as suspected, and the ability to \ndetect reinfection is hindered due to the absence of documented history of a prior probable or confirmed \nmpox episode. However, in the context of ongoing local outbreaks with significant numbers of cases, their \ntypical clinical presentation15,43 can be very suggestive of mpox. In these settings, WHO encourages countries \nto define and classify suspected mpox cases with a known epidemiological link to a confirmed case or cluster \nas probable cases, in line with the above case definitions.  \nHere we propose definitions for a suspected, probable, and confirmed MPXV reinfection for surveillance \npurposes. These aim to assist clinicians, researchers, and public health officials by standardizing the reporting \nof MPXV reinfections across countries. \nGiven the emerging evidence, these definitions incorporate pragmatic and implementation-focused \napproaches.

For more \ndetails, please refer to the WHO interim guidance on laboratory testing for MPXV.47 \nAny patient with suspected mpox should be isolated during the presumed and known infectious periods, \nthat is during the prodromal and rash stages of the illness, respectively.  \nInvestigating exposure to an infected animal \nThe monkeypox virus was first identified in 1958 in non-human primates50, and cases of human mpox have \nbeen described in the African context since 1970.51 In countries where MPXV is endemic in wildlife population, \nthe proportion of human cases that can be attributed to zoonotic transmission is unknown but is likely to \nplay an important role in mpox outbreaks.  \nRoutes of infection include direct contact with an infected animal (bites, scratches, etc.), their body fluids, or \npotentially their faeces. Mpox might also be contracted through preparation or consumption of insufficiently \nprocessed products (e.g., meat) from wild animal. MPXV infection has been reported in a wide range of \nmammal species such as monkeys, squirrels, dormice, and pouched rats; most of these were sampled in \ncaptive animals. Neither the animal reservoir(s), which maintain the virus in nature, nor the range of potential \nintermediate animal hosts, which could play a role in animal-to-human transmission, are known. Therefore, \nit is critical to investigate cases for potential exposure to MPXV-infected animals, to conduct animal \ninvestigations to prevent further introductions of the virus into the human population, and to provide useful \ninsights to reduce future spillover risks. Further investigations and studies are needed to understand the \nrelative proportion (compared to human-to-human transmission) and risk factors for zoonotic transmission. \nWhen exposure to an infected animal or animal products is suspected,, it is important to collect information \nduring the case investigation on the animal species (preferably the exact species, for example by using species \nkeys or collecting samples for DNA barcoding) with which the case came into contact, the time and place of \nthe contact, the types and frequency of contact, information on whether the animal was caught alive or \nfound dead, and whether the animal presented any signs of illness.3Investigations regarding animal \nexposures are difficult because of the high frequency of animal-human contact in endemic areas, and \nbecause of several weeks passing between exposure and investigations (due to the incubation period and \ndelays in identification and notification). For this reason, exposure investigations should be conducted as \nsoon as possible after a case has been identified.  \nWHO has included a specific section on animal exposure on the mpox Case Investigation Form (CIF).3 The \nstandardized data collection for animal exposure will allow animal and health authorities to more easily \ncompile and compare this information in order to better quantify animal exposure risk. This is particularly \nimportant for countries in East, Central and West Africa, and will also be useful for any situation or context \nin which zoonotic transmission or exposure to infected animals is considered a possibility. \nContact tracing \nContact tracing is a key public health measure to control the spread of infectious pathogens such as MPXV. \nIt allows for the interruption of chains of transmission and can also help people at a higher risk of developing \nsevere disease to identify their exposure more quickly, so they can monitor their health status and seek \nmedical care quickly if they become symptomatic. Cases should be interviewed as soon as possible to elicit \nthe names and contact information of all potential contacts and identify events, gatherings, venues or places \nvisited where contact with other people may have occurred. Contacts of cases should be notified within 24"

In the absence of symptoms, a person with a \npositive PCR test for mpox, for example from an oropharyngeal or anal swab, should also be considered a \nconfirmed case and infectious; contact-tracing initiated as outlined here. \nContact identification and notification \nCases can be prompted to identify contacts across several contexts, including household, workplace, \nschool/nursery, sexual contacts, healthcare (including laboratory exposure), houses of worship, social \ngatherings, festivals, and any other recalled interactions. Attendance lists, passenger manifests, or other \nmethods such as web or mobile applications can be used to identify contacts at events, gatherings, during \ntravel or on conveyances such as cruise ships.  \nAny patient or other person exposed to contaminated materials from a patient/person with mpox in the \nhealth care or other congregate setting or venue should be considered a contact even in the absence of direct \nexposure to the case.  \nIn settings where zoonotic transmission occurs, community contacts for point source exposure may include \nother persons hunting, selling, preparing or consuming the bushmeat meal at the same time. \nExperience during the ongoing multi-country mpox outbreak, as well as previous outbreaks, shows that some \ncases may be reluctant or unable to provide contact information for all contacts, especially sexual contacts. \nTo overcome this challenge, public health authorities should encourage cases to directly notify their contacts \nand provide them advice on how best to do this.

In the endemic setting where access to laboratory confirmation of \nmpox is limited, this definition includes deaths among persons with suspected (clinically compatible) mpox, \nwhich are to be considered suspected mpox deaths. The diagnosis for mpox can also be confirmed after the \ndeath has occurred if there is sufficient lesion material to perform PCR testing. There should be no period of \ncomplete recovery between the illness and death for the death to be recorded as a mpox death.  \nMost persons with mpox who died have had a co-existing health condition, and mpox may not fully explain \nthe outcome for the case. Nevertheless, for surveillance purposes, it is important to count and report all \ncases that die with MPXV infection to improve understanding of the full spectrum of disease. Although some \ncountries undertake detailed medical investigations to decide on the most likely cause of death and may not \nrule the case a ‘mpox death’, WHO reiterates the importance of reporting all deaths among mpox cases. \nWastewater surveillance for mpox \nWastewater surveillance, also known as environmental surveillance (ES), has been shown to assist in public \nhealth decision-making for a number of public health threats – most notably for polio, typhoid, COVID-19, \nillicit drugs and antimicrobial resistance.55 ES provides cost-effective population-level data on trends that are \nuseful when they reveal information not reflected in clinical data because individuals are asymptomatic \nand/or do not access testing and treatment services.56 ES can provide early warning of emergence, re-\nemergence, or surges of disease and help detect hotspot areas for investigation. Additionally, information \nfrom ES can be integrated into risk communication as a reminder of ongoing risk in communities. Banking of \nsamples allows retrospective analysis to be performed.56 \nMonkeypox viral DNA has been detected in urine, faeces, saliva, skin and mucosal lesions as well as semen \nsamples of confirmed mpox cases in different countries. 57–59 Live (replication competent) MPXV has been \nisolated from skin and mucosal lesions, semen, genital and rectal swabs. The concentration and persistence \nof virus or viral DNA shedding from the different sites vary based on the duration of the infection, and \nalthough no clear description of these dynamics is currently available, studies show that shedding can last up \nto 16 days from symptoms onset.60 \nThe virus present in mucosal and skin lesions can be released into wastewater during teeth brushing, hand \nwashing, showers or baths, and from urine and faeces via toilets. Detecting MPXV DNA or live virus in \nwastewater is one method to detect ongoing community transmission in a specific area. 61,62  \nIn the year and a half prior to this edition of the surveillance guidance, several countries began monitoring \nMPXV DNA presence in wastewater63 and results have been made available for multiple countries.46–53 \nConversely, detection of replication-competent (live) MPXV in wastewater has not yet been reported. There \nis no known case to date of mpox contracted from contact with contaminated wastewater.  \nTheoretical research studies have estimated that wastewater surveillance could feasibly detect seven \ninfections out of 100 000 people,64 and observations in the United States of America highlighted that \nwastewater surveillance has a sensitivity of 32% for detecting a single mpox case in wastewater samples that \nrepresent thousands to millions of persons.65 Sensitivity increases as the number of cases in the community \nincreases.
