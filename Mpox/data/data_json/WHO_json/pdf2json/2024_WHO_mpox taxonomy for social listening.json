The first steps in managing an infodemic are social listening and integrated analysis. \nIntegrated analysis is best done with a diverse set of data sources across social, program, behavioral, \nmedia, and epidemiological domains. Infodemic monitoring and intelligence gathering consider as \nmany relevant data sources as possible, recognizing they all individually have limitations and biases, \nbut when analyzed in an integrated manner, can yield insights that data sources analyzed in \nisolation would not provide.  \n \nA public health taxonomy is a system of classification or structure that allows an analyst to align data \nwith a search strategy to better understand domains related to a public health topic of interest 2. \nTaxonomies are generally used to help analyze data that make up an infodemic insights report, \nwhich is used to inform public health action to better address people’s questions, concerns, \ninformation voids, narratives and circulating mis- and disinformation, all of which make up the \ninformation environment and can affect people’s risk perception, awareness and behavior on a \nhealth topic. A taxonomy can help organize and map the information on, perception of, discussion \nand behaviour around a public health topic that are most concentrated, where conversations seem \nto be missing or silent, and where new topics or concerns may emerge. Taxonomies have been \ndeveloped and implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) for respiratory pathogens, \nCOVID-19, and for mpox. Infodemic monitoring and insights generation encompasses systematic \nanalysis of different data sources, generation of intelligence, turning the intelligence into infodemic \ninsights and applying structured judgment and risk matrix approach to generate recommendations \nfor action.  \n \nObjective  \nMillions of daily conversations by members of various communities can provide a better \nunderstanding of how the multi-country outbreak of mpox outbreak is perceived, understood and \ndiscussed. The objective of the taxonomy is to support the monitoring of conversations related to \nmpox within thematic categories relevant to public health response. The subtopics are to capture \nbreadth of conversations and help identify structure and changes in narratives. The taxonomy can \nbe applied to both online and offline social listening and can facilitate structured integrated analysis \nof the data to produce infodemic insights and recommendations.  \n \n \n \n \n1 Briand S, Hess S, Nguyen T, Purnat TD.
