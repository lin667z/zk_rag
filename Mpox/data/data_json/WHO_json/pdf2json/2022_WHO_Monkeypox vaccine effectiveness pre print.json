To control the \noutbreak, Modified Vaccinia Ankara–Bavaria Nordic (MVA-BN), an attenuated \nsmallpox vaccine, was offered to high-risk GBMSM. We assessed the effectiveness \nof a single MVA-BN dose against monkeypox disease in high-risk GBMSM.  \nMethods \nMonkeypox cases in England were sent questionnaires collecting information on \ndemographics, vaccination history and symptoms. Returned questionnaires with a \nrash onset date (or alternative proxy) between 4 July and 9 October 2022 were \nincluded. Females, heterosexual men, and those with missing vaccination \ninformation were excluded. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using the case-\ncoverage method where vaccine coverage among cases is compared to coverage in \nthe eligible population, estimated from doses given to GBMSM and the estimated \nsize of high-risk GBMSM. Sensitivity analysis included +/-20% differences in \nestimated high-risk GBMSM population size. \nFindings  \nVaccine uptake among eligible GBMSM increased steadily from July 2022, reaching \n47% by 9 October 2022. Of the 363 confirmed cases, 8 occurred ≥14 days after \nvaccination, 32 within 0 to 13 days after vaccination, and the rest were unvaccinated."

We also scoped pre-print databases \nvaccine effectiveness studies during the current outbreak. Only publications related \nto the Modified Vaccinia Ankara – Bavaria Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine were included. \nIn the UK, MVA-BN was offered to high-risk GBMSM to control a national outbreak \nwhich began in May 2022. MVA-BN is now licensed against smallpox in the US, \nEurope and the UK, there are, however, limited data on vaccine effectiveness \nagainst monkeypox. Preclinical studies indicated two vaccine doses were \nimmunogenic and generated antibody levels considered protective against smallpox. \nVaccine-induced antibodies are also cross-protective against monkeypox virus in \nvitro and in animal models. A recent, as yet unpublished, Israeli study estimated 79% \nvaccine effectiveness after one dose in high-risk GBMSM, while a US study reported \nunvaccinated individuals to be 14 times more likely to develop monkeypox disease \nthan vaccinated persons. \n  \nAdded value of this study \nFew countries have recommended or introduced large-scale vaccination against the \ncurrent global outbreak of monkeypox disease among GBMSM in non-endemic \ncountries. The offer of MVA-BN to high-risk GBMSM through sexual health clinics in \nEngland provided a unique opportunity to rapidly assess vaccine effectiveness after \na single dose using the case-coverage method, which involves comparing vaccine \ncoverage in cases to vaccine coverage in the eligible population. Our vaccine \neffectiveness estimate of 78% at least 14 days after one MVA-BN dose is consistent \nwith Israeli estimates and provided additional evidence of a lack of protection during \nthe first 13 days after vaccination. \n \nImplications of all the available evidence  \nA single dose of MVA-BN is highly protective against monkeypox disease and \nprovides a useful tool for outbreak control when rapid protection may be needed. \nGiven the lack of effectiveness in the first 13 days after the first dose and a median \nincubation period of 8 to 9 days after exposure to the virus, vaccination is likely to be \nmost effective when offered as pre-exposure rather than prophylaxis. Because of the \nhigh vaccine effectiveness after one MVA-BN dose, in outbreaks where number of \nat-risk individuals exceed vaccine supply of 2-doses, there may be benefit in \nprioritising delivery of first doses at the expense of delaying the second dose."

Proxy indicators, \nincluding recent bacterial sexually transmitted infection (in the past year) or eligibility \nfor HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, were used to identify eligible groups 7 with roll-out \nstarting at the end of June 2022  for this group. 8 \n \nModified Vaccinia Ankara – Bavaria Nordic (MVA-BN), is a third-generation \nattenuated replication deficient smallpox vaccine licensed by the European \nMedicines Agency (EMA) in 2013 for the prevention of smallpox. 9 In the US, the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approved MVA-BN for the prevention of \nmonkeypox as well as smallpox in 2019.10 The vaccine was licensed based on \nimmunogenicity studies only; a 2 dose schedule given 28 days apart was \ndemonstrated to be immunogenic, generating antibody levels above protective \nthresholds for smallpox, which was also considered to also confer protection against \nmonkeypox. 11,12 Animal models have also shown rapid protection against \nmonkeypox. 13-16   \n \nAlthough data from studies in Africa suggested that previous generation smallpox \nvaccination also protected against monkeypox, 16,17 there were no real-world data on \nthe effectiveness of third-generation smallpox vaccines against monkeypox disease \nin humans prior to the current outbreak.16 A recent study involving subjects"

The analysis did not report VE \nwithin and after 14 days, with a follow-up interval of 25 days after vaccination.  \nSimilarly, a US study reported a 14-fold higher incidence of monkeypox disease in \nunvaccinated individuals eligible for MVA-BN compared to those receiving at least \nvaccine dose in 32 jurisdictions, covering 56% of the US population eligible for \nvaccination, with similar trends observed in a sensitivity analysis but lower relative \nincidence rates. 20  This risk is equivalent to a vaccine effectiveness of around 93%. \nSimilarly to our study, the authors used aggregate data provided by public health \njurisdictions, which obtained vaccination date from case interviews and/or linkage to \nvaccine registries. 26 They restricted their analysis by age to exclude anyone who \nmight have been vaccinated with the smallpox vaccination in childhood (those aged \n50+ years), as we did in our secondary analysis. We also focused on VE at least 14 \ndays after vaccination to allow time for an immune response to develop after \nvaccination. The higher VE in the US study may in part be explained by the fact that \nthey excluded those with possible prior smallpox vaccination (which we cannot \nexclude from our population comparator), and they also included a small number \nwho had received second doses. Another study conducted in France, focused on \nsubjects who received post-exposure vaccination, researchers reported 12/276 (4%) \nhad a confirmed monkeypox breakthrough infection.26 Of these 12 cases, 10 were \nwithin 1 to 5 days of vaccination. This highlights the importance of considering the \nperiod soon after vaccination separately in our study.  \n \nOur effectiveness results after one dose are also consistent with pre-clinical studies \nbased on immunogenicity responses and animal models.12,14 One of these studies \nassessed the response after one single dose of MVA in animal models challenged \nwith monkeypox.14 Full protection was shown after 30 days but antibody response \nand protection against severe disease (and death) was shown as soon as 4 days \nafter vaccination – although the sample size was small.14 During this outbreak, \nZaeck et al showed low levels of MPXV neutralizing antibodies after one dose of \nvaccine in a small sample of human subjects. 18 Interestingly, there was a difference \nbetween individuals born before or after 1974 – with 63% of the younger group \neliciting neutralizing antibodies compared with 100% of those born before 1974, 18"

These individuals also showed higher levels of \nneutralizing antibodies than those born after 1974 - unlikely to have received any \nprevious smallpox vaccination. 18 Correlates of protection for monkeypox are unclear \nand further studies are required including serology and clinical outcomes. However, \nthis study suggests the need to differentiate between subjects previously vaccinated \nduring childhood and unvaccinated individuals. This is in line with reports from \nsurveillance data from Africa suggesting a protective effect of previous smallpox \nvaccination, in some cases estimated to be about 85% effective. 16,17 In line with \nthese results, our analysis in cases under 50 years of age, which are less likely to \nhave been vaccinated prior to this outbreak, also showed slightly lower VE. \n \n \nThere are some limitations to this analysis. Firstly, we assumed all cases are vaccine \neligible GBMSM unless they reported as female or heterosexual. A small number of \ncases may not have been eligible for vaccination. Given the high percentage of all \ncases in England self-reporting as GBMSM (96.8%)22, however, this should not have \na measurable influence in the final analysis. We relied on questionnaire data to \nobtain case vaccine status. The questionnaire return rate was low (about 33%) and, \npotentially, if vaccinated cases are more likely to return completed questionnaires, \nVE would be underestimated and vice versa. Vaccine information was obtained only \nfrom self-reported data, there is no national vaccination registry with identifiable data \nfor this programme. There is also some uncertainty on the GBMSM denominator, \nresulting in a range of VE from 75%-87% in the sensitivity analyses. Given the \naggregated nature of the vaccine coverage data, we were also unable to adjust for \nother potential confounders other than time period. This could lead to VE being \noverestimated or underestimated. For example, if cases within the GBMSM \npopulation included in the study were younger, but vaccine uptake was higher in \nolder individuals then VE would be overestimated (and note that the age of cases \nincluded in the study compared to all cases was slightly younger, but we do not know \nif coverage differed by age). Behavioural changes post-vaccination may also have \naffected VE estimates; for example, if vaccinated individuals were less likely to \nabstain from high-risk sexual activity as a result of having received the vaccine then \nthe pharmacological effectiveness would be underestimated. We considered \nindividuals vaccinated prior to 2022 as unvaccinated because we could only assess \nthe effect of vaccination as part of the 2022 immunisation campaign since it was not \npossible to split vaccine coverage by prior vaccine status. If prior vaccination has \nsome residual protection, then this means that our estimates may be lower than the \ntrue VE. The fact that VE was similar when restricting to cases aged under 50 who \nwere less likely to have received a vaccine prior to 2022 suggests the bias may be \nfairly small. However, many cases are in people born outside of the UK, including \nfrom regions where smallpox vaccination programmes may have ended later than \n1971. Also, some GBMSM cases might be healthcare workers or laboratory workers \nwho might have received vaccination. Therefore, this age cut-off still includes some \ncases who had been previously vaccinated. In fact, 7% of <50s reported vaccination"

The fact this estimate is close to zero \nprovides some reassurance that these potential biases are unlikely to be having a \nmajor impact on our VE estimates for ≥14 days post-vaccination.  \n \nFinally, vaccination using an intradermal vaccination route instead of subcutaneous \nto maximise the number of doses was recommended in the UK from August 22, \n2022, with variable rollout dates across the country and with variable implementation \nbetween clinics. 7 By November 2022, 65% of sites were offering intradermal \nvaccinations. Consequently, most doses in our analysis would have been \nadministered subcutaneously and, therefore, our VE estimates relate mainly to \nsubcutaneous vaccinations. Any VE differences between subcutaneous and \nintradermal administration will need to be assessed in future studies. \n \nConclusions \nOur results suggest relatively high level of protection from a single dose of MVA-BN \n– making it a useful tool against monkeypox for outbreak control when rapid \nprotection is needed. This suggests that where numbers at highest risk of infection \nexceed vaccine supply of 2-doses, there may be benefit in prioritising delivery of first \ndoses. Further work is needed to evaluate the duration of protection as well as the \neffectiveness of a full 2 dose course. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank NHS England for their collection and sharing of vaccination \ncoverage rates for the monkeypox vaccination programme delivered through sexual \nhealth services.
