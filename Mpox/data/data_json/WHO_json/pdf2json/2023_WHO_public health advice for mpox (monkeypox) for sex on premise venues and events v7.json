It contains \npractical advice on steps that can be taken to protect \npeople from mpox. The advice in this document should be \nadapted to the local setting. \nWhat we know about mpox is rapidly changing. This \ndocument contains the most up-to-date information from \nWHO on preventing and managing mpox, but this advice \nmay evolve as we learn more.  \n \nKeep up-to-date at www.who.org. \nTarget audiences for this tool:\n•\t Owners and managers of sex-on-premises venues\n•\t Organisers of sex-on-premises events at hired or \ninformal venues\n•\t Staff and volunteers at venues and \nevents\n•\t Influencers, activists, community \nadvocates and civil society \norganizations\n•\t Individuals attending sex-on-premises venues or \nevents \n•\t \tLocal and national public health authorities  \nBackground:  \n \nOutbreaks of mpox are occurring in many countries \nglobally. In many settings, cases are being identified in \ncommunities of gay, bisexual, and other men who have \nsex with men (MSM) who have had recent sexual contact \nwith a new partner or multiple sexual partners. However, \nthe risk is not limited to these groups.\nHuman to human spread of mpox can occur through \nclose contact with someone who is infected, including \nthrough touching, kissing, oral, vaginal or anal sex. The \nvirus can also spread through contact with contaminated \nenvironments via clothing, bedding, towels, objects \n(including sex toys), and surfaces. \n1 March 2023\nSince the beginning of the most recent multi-country \noutbreak, clusters of mpox have been connected to \nsex-on-premises venues and events. Sex-on-premises \nvenues can include saunas, sex clubs, bath houses, or \nbusinesses with back rooms and dark rooms; events refer \nto both private and commercial sex-on-premises events. \nSpecial considerations and precautionary measures \nare necessary for venues and events where there is sex \non premises to reduce the risk of mpox for staff, people \nattending venues/events, and communities.\nIn the context of the current outbreak, mpox-associated \nrisks should be considered and factored in when planning \na gathering or event. Postponing or cancelling gatherings \nin areas where mpox cases have been detected is not \nrequired as a default measure.\nMost sex-on-premises venues catering for gay, bisexual \nand other men who have sex with men are familiar with \nproviding an environment that supports attendees seeking \nsafer sex in the context of human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Mpox \nconsiderations can be readily included in the approaches \nin place to protect against HIV and STI transmission.\nHow to use this document:  \n \nThis document contains practical advice to \nhelp reduce the risk of mpox transmission in \nsex-on-premises venues and at sex-on-premises \nevents. It is intended to be adapted to your specific \nneeds and it can be used as a basis for community \nconversations, information sessions, or producing \ncommunity information for your communities. \nSee the considerations for different stakeholders at \nthe end of this document to support the use of this \ndocument by different actors."

Anyone who has close \ncontact with someone who is infectious is at risk. \nOutbreaks of monkeypox in newly affected \ncountries have mostly been identified in communities \nof gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with \nmen who have had recent sexual contact with a \nnew partner or partners. Communities of trans and \ngender diverse people linked to the same sexual \nnetworks have also been affected. \nWhile the risk is not limited to these groups, the \noutbreak has become an additional focus for stigma \nand discrimination directed against men who have \nsex with men, trans people and broader lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex communities \nand their families. Similarly, stigma, discrimination \nand other expressions of racism towards \ncommunities from previously affected regions \nhas increased as a result of the new outbreak of \nmonkeypox.\nStigma and discrimination connected to any \ndisease, including monkeypox, are never \nacceptable. They can have a serious impact on \nhealth outcomes and undermine the outbreak \nresponse by making people reluctant to come \nforward or seek care. This increases the risk of \ntransmission – both within the most affected \ncommunities and beyond.  \nThe impact of stigma and discrimination on \nthe monkeypox outbreak must be mitigated \nthrough active strategies to prevent people \nbeing unable or unwilling to access health \nservices and support and to create an enabling \nenvironment where people feel able to report \ntheir symptoms. \nThis public health advice from WHO provides information on the potential impact of stigma, \nrecommended language and actions to counter stigmatizing attitudes and discriminatory \nbehaviours and policies related to the monkeypox outbreak. It will be updated as more is known \nabout effective strategies against stigma and discrimination in the context of this outbreak. \n1 September 2022\nA note before we start \nPeople often stigmatize others without being \naware that they’re doing it, and without any \nmalicious intent. People automatically make \njudgments about others without realizing how \nit might affect them. In fact, most people have \nfelt ostracized or been treated like a minority \nat some time in their lives. We all find ourselves \nperpetuating harmful stereotypes or falling back \non unconscious biases at times. Being aware of \none's own unconscious bias is important, but even \nmore important is to not allow those implicit biases \nto cause discrimination to be enabled or ignored.\nProactively reflecting and acting on our own \nlanguage, behaviour and intentions as individuals \nand as agencies is essential to reducing the \nharm caused by stigma and discrimination. \nHaving good intentions is not enough – this \ninterim guidance is for everyone working on or \nconcerned by monkeypox. Fear of perpetuating \nstigma and discrimination should not stop \nindividuals and organizations from speaking up \non important issues; the most important thing we \ncan do is to be reflective, seek feedback, call out \nstigma and discrimination where we see it and be \nopen to learning and changing our behaviour."

Remember that the rash can also be found \nin places that can be hard or impossible to see inside the body, including the mouth, throat, genitals, \nvagina, anus or rectum, and people may have this infection without knowing. Wearing a condom won’t \nfully protect you from catching mpox, but it will help protect you and others from a range of other STIs.  \n•\t If you think you have mpox, have open, non-judgmental conversations with the people you come into \nclose contact with at the event. \n•\t If you have symptoms, seek health advice on getting tested for mpox as well as other STIs before going \nto an event or sex-on-premises venue. If you don’t know your HIV status, be sure to also ask for an HIV \ntest.\n•\t If you are at risk of exposure to mpox get vaccinated if it is available to you in your context."
