Check Monkeypox outbreak 2022 - Global (who.int) for \nthe most up to date information.\nRisk-based approach for gatherings\nPrinciples\nWHO recommends that the decision-making process \nrelated to holding, modifying, postponing or cancelling \ngatherings of any size and type should rely on a risk-based \napproach, tailored to the characteristics of the event under \nconsideration and be repeated at regular intervals.\nThe risk-based approach entails three steps:\n1.\t Risk evaluation: identification and quantification of the \nbaseline risks based on the characteristics of the event \nand the context in which it takes place;\n2.\t Risk mitigation: application of a package of precautionary \nmeasures aimed at decreasing the baseline risk;\n3.\t Risk communication: proactive dissemination of \ninformation on the measures adopted, their rationale and \npurpose, and on how the relevant decisions were taken.\n28 June 2022\nIn the context of the current outbreak, monkeypox-associated \nrisks should be considered and factored in when planning a \ngathering event.\nPostponing or cancelling gatherings in areas where \nmonkeypox cases have been detected is not required as a \ndefault measure.\nMonkeypox-associated risks during the \ncurrent outbreak\nIn the context of the current monkeypox outbreak, cases \nhave been primarily identified among some gay, bisexual and \nother men who have sex with men including those who have \nreported recent sex with a new partner or multiple partners.\nKey transmission routes include skin-to-skin, mouth-to \nmouth and mouth-to-skin contact during sexual activity. \nTransmission can also occur through skin-to-skin contact \nnot related to sexual practices, face-to-face contact via \nrespiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces \nor material; it is still unclear if infected people with no \nsymptoms can transmit the monkeypox virus, making it \nimportant for anyone attending gatherings to exert \nadditional care.\nBackground\nThe unexpected appearance of monkeypox in several WHO \nregions in the initial absence of epidemiological links to areas \nthat have historically reported monkeypox suggests that \nthere may have been undetected transmission for some time. \nEpidemiological investigations are ongoing.\nMost reported monkeypox cases have presented through \nsexual health or other health services in primary or \nsecondary healthcare facilities.\nThe identification of confirmed and suspected cases of \nmonkeypox with no direct travel links to previously affected \nareas is atypical, and even a single case of monkeypox in a \nnewly affected country is considered an outbreak.\nFor the latest information on transmission, signs and \nsymptoms please refer to Clinical management and infection \nprevention and control for monkeypox: Interim rapid \nresponse guidance.\nScope\nGatherings are events characterized by the concentration \nof people at a specific location for a specific purpose over \na set period of time, and may be public or private, planned \nor spontaneous, recurrent or one-off, and also of varying \nsize, duration and visibility. They can be of different nature, \nincluding, although not limited to, sports, religious, cultural, \nentertainment, political, business and health-campaign \nevents.\nDuring gatherings, the likely high density and mobility of \nattendees (crowding) represents a conducive environment \nfor close, prolonged and frequent interactions between \npeople. Some gatherings may lead to attendees socially \ninteracting with people previously unknown to them. For \nsome, these new interactions could lead to sexual activity \nwhich can play a role in the spread of the monkeypox virus."

Should any factors change, \nWHO will issue a further update."
