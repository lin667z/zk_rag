                "page_content": "Diagnostic testing for the monkeypox virus (MPXV): Interim guidance \n-2- \nChanges from earlier version  \nThis is an updated version of the interim guidance on Diagnostic testing for the monkeypox virus and supersedes the \nguidance published on 9 November 2023. This version includes updated recommendations to highlight diagnostic \nstrategies to avoid gene target failures and determine monkeypox virus (MPXV) clades. This version is in alignment \nwith other updated interim guidance documents published by WHO since November 2023. \nIntroduction \nMpox (formerly known as monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), a double-\nstranded DNA virus, that belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family. The virus was first discovered \nin 1958 as the cause of outbreaks of a pox-like disease in monkeys kept for research in Denmark. Human disease \nwas first identified in 1970 in a 9-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.(3–5) Orthopoxviruses can \ncause disease in humans and other mammals. Symptomatic infection typically results in the formation of lesions, \nskin nodules or disseminated rash. Other orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) pathogenic to humans include Cowpox virus and \nVariola virus (causing smallpox).  Smallpox vaccines derived from Vaccinia virus, also an orthopoxvirus, were a key \ntool for the eradication of smallpox, which was achieved in 1980. \nMPXV was named based on its initial detection in captive monkeys and, although the virus continues to affect \nspecies of monkeys in Africa, the main animal reservoirs are likely small forest mammals such as rodents and \nsquirrels. There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, mainly found in the Congo Basin region, and clade II, which \ncontains two subclades, designated as clade IIa and clade IIb. (6) Clade IIb is the predominant strain in the ongoing \nglobal outbreak, which was recognized in May 2022 and has disproportionally affected men who have sex with men. \nOver many years and especially since 2012, an increasing trend in clade I detections has also been reported in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo with a marked rise in cases reported since 2023. In addition to transmission in \nendemic areas considered to be often zoonotic transmission with associated household and community spread (7), \nhuman-to-human transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV has also continued to increase. For the first time in \n2023, sexual transmission of clade I MPXV has also been documented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nwhere outbreaks associated with sexual contact have occurred and are ongoing (8,9).  Outbreaks linked to sexual \ntransmission are occurring among sex workers in mining communities, in clusters of cases among men who have \nsex with men, and through heterosexual transmission in households. \nMPXV has a linear DNA genome and is approximately 200 kb long. The genome has a highly conserved central region \ncoding for replication and its assembly machinery. (10)In addition, the genome has the more variable ends that \ncontain inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) ends, which contain genes involved in host range determination and \npathogenesis. MPXV contains at least 4 open reading frames (ORFs) in the ITR region (11). For clade I and clade II, \ndeletions and duplications of parts of the less conserved regions in the MPXV genome termini have been described \n(11–17). These deletions can lead to loss of detection with MPXV clade specific NAAT tests. (12,14,18) Therefore \nmonitoring the genomic evolution of MPXV and the potential impact on performance of NAAT assays used is \nstrongly recommended. NAAT assays are further discussed in the laboratory-based testing methods section.  \nMpox can cause a range of signs and symptoms. The classic incubation period  ranged from 5 to 21 days.(19) The \nclassic mpox presentation is a short  prodromal phase lasting 1-5 days. During this time patients may experience \nfever, headache, back pain, muscle aches, and lymphadenopathy.(20) The second phase typically occurs after the \nfever subsides, with the appearance of skin and/or mucosal rash, which might include a single or multiple \nlesions.(21,22) Typically, the lesions progress through macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules, before crusting over \nand desquamating over a period of 2 to 4 weeks.(3) \n \nDuring  the 2022-2023 multi-country mpox outbreak, the recorded incubation period ranged from 1 to 12 days (23),  \noccasionally last much longer  (up to 40 days).(25) Patients presented  with more mucosal lesions than previously \ndescribed, often  localized in the genital or perineal/perianal area and / or involving the mouth and eyes.(26,27) The \nprodromal period was often absent: an observational study reported that in half of patients, skin lesions were the \nfirst sign of infection.(28) Anorectal pain and bleeding (e.g. due to proctitis) was also newly reported in the global \noutbreak.(1) Lymphadenopathy remains a common feature of mpox, usually appearing early in the course of \nillness.(26)  \nPersons with suspected, probable or confirmed mpox, should follow appropriate isolation and infection control \nguidance to prevent onward transmission. Similarly, health workers and laboratory personnel should also follow \nappropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE),"

Detailed information and recommendations for clinical management, including treatment \noptions and IPC strategies, can be found here.(29) These measures are advised until all skin lesions are \nepithelialized, crusts fall off, and other symptoms such as proctitis have subsided.   \nPoint-of-care technologies are emerging, but currently mpox diagnosis is primarily reliant on laboratory-based \nnucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). WHO has released target product profiles for NAAT assays to be used for \nmpox diagnosis within health care settings and laboratories and for tests targeting orthopoxvirus antigen(s) to be \nused as an aid to mpox diagnosis for decentralized use, including in the community. \nTarget audience \nThis document provides interim guidance for clinicians, laboratories, health workers, public health officials and \nother stakeholders involved in the diagnosis and care of patients with suspected or confirmed mpox.  \nIndications for testing \nAny individual meeting the locally adapted WHO definition for a suspected or clinically compatible case of mpox \nshould be offered testing (see Box 1). The decision to test should be based on both clinical and epidemiological \nfactors, linked to an assessment of the likelihood of infection and the risk of further spread.  \nThe rash that develops in mpox may resemble other infectious diseases or conditions, making it challenging to \ndifferentiate mpox solely based on clinical presentation. It is therefore important to consider other potential causes \nof discrete skin lesions or a disseminated rash; including varicella zoster virus (VZV, chickenpox), measles, scabies, \nherpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (syphilis); other OPXV in different settings such as buffalopox or \nbovine vaccinia or manifestations of vaccinia infection; parapoxviruses (causing orf or molluscum contagiosum), \nand rarely tanapox. Other causes of rash in the differential diagnosis may include disseminated gonococcal \ninfection (DGI), vasculitis, bacterial skin and soft tissue infections, medication allergies and chancroid.(1,29,30)  \n \nBox 1: Definition of a suspected case (from “Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for mpox” (1)):  \nA person who is a contact of a probable or confirmed mpox case in the 21 days before the onset of \nsigns or symptoms, and who presents with any of the following: acute onset of fever (>38.5°C), \nheadache, myalgia (muscle pain/body aches), back pain, profound weakness or fatigue.  \nOR  \nA person presenting since 01 January 2022 with an unexplained acute skin rash, mucosal lesions or \nlymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). The skin rash may include single or multiple lesions in \nthe ano-genital region or elsewhere on the body. Mucosal lesions may include single or multiple \noral, conjunctival, urethral, penile, vaginal, or anorectal lesions. Anorectal lesions can also manifest \nas anorectal inflammation (proctitis), pain and/or bleeding.  \nAND  \nfor which the following common causes of acute rash or skin lesions do not fully explain the clinical \npicture: varicella zoster, herpes zoster, measles, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, \ndisseminated gonococcal infection, primary or secondary syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma \nvenereum, granuloma inguinale, molluscum contagiosum, allergic reaction (e.g. to plants); and any \nother locally relevant common causes of papular or vesicular rash. \n \nPrior infection with mpox or vaccination does not guarantee full protection from future infection. Therefore, if an \nindividual presents with clinical symptoms suggestive of mpox, it is crucial that they seek prompt medical \nattention; undergo testing for mpox, HIV and other STIs as indicated particularly for cases that may be linked to \nsexual transmission; and receive appropriate medical care.(31) If resources are limited, patients at high-risk for \nsevere infection such as immunocompromised individuals, should be prioritized for testing.  \nCurrently, there are insufficient data on the usefulness or cost-effectiveness of screening for MPXV in asymptomatic \nindividuals at high risk of infection.(32,33)"

All specimens collected for \nlaboratory investigations should be regarded as potentially infectious and handled with caution. Measures should \nbe taken to minimize the risk of laboratory transmission based on risk assessment when testing routine clinical \nspecimens from patients with suspected or confirmed mpox. These may include limiting the number of staff testing \nspecimens only to staff with proven competency, wearing appropriate PPE, using rigorously applied standard \nprecautions, and avoiding any procedures that could generate infectious aerosols. Use of sharp instruments should \nbe avoided. It should also be noted that there may be high rates of undetected HIV in persons with suspected or \nconfirmed mpox, which heightens the importance of universal precautions.(34,35)  \nThe WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) recommends primary preventive vaccination \n(PPV) for persons at risk during outbreaks including children, as well as for health workers, including laboratory \npersonnel, at risk for repeated exposure. SAGE also recommends post-exposure preventive (PEPV) vaccination for \ncontacts of cases, ideally within 4 days of exposure (and up to 14 days in the absence of symptoms).(36,37)  \nEffective disinfectants include quaternary ammonium compounds and 0.5% bleach (freshly made). Rigorous \nadherence to infection prevention and control guidelines must be ensured during specimen collection and \nhandling.(29) \nSpecimen to be collected (see Annex). The recommended specimen type for laboratory confirmation of MPXV is skin \nlesion material, including swabs of lesion surface and/or exudate, or lesion crusts. Swab the lesion vigorously, to \nensure adequate viral DNA is collected. Swabs can be transported dry in capped tubes or placed in viral transport \nmedia (VTM). Specimens from two lesions should be collected in one single tube, preferably from different locations \non the body. Lesions, crusts and vesicular fluids should not be mixed in the same tube. Because the definition of a \nsuspected case includes symptomatic contacts of confirmed or probable mpox cases, alternative specimen types, \nsuch as oropharyngeal swabs, can be collected in the absence of skin or mucosal lesions. However, such specimen \ntypes provide less sensitive results for diagnosis than material from skin lesions. For this reason, a negative result \nshould be interpreted with caution (38–42). Blood specimens are generally not useful for diagnosis of acute illness, \nunless this is taken to rule out other infections. The type of specimen may depend on the clinical presentation and \ncontact exposure (see the Annex).  \nCollection of additional specimen types for research purposes can be considered if it is allowed by the appropriate \nethics review board and there is sufficient laboratory and medical expertise for their safe collection, handling, and \nstorage. These may include urine, semen, vitreous fluid or cerebrospinal fluid on indication and based on clinical \npresentation, including location of lesions and contact exposure.(26,39,40,43). EDTA blood may support detection \nof MPXV but may not contain the high level of virus found in lesion specimens because any viremia usually occurs \nearly in the course of infection in the prodromal period before skin lesions become manifest and is of short \nduration. These additional specimen types are not intended for routine diagnostic purposes and do not need to be \ncollected outside of research settings. More details on specimen collection and storage are included in the Annex. \nPackaging and shipment of clinical specimens. Specimens should be stored refrigerated or frozen within an hour of \ncollection and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection. Correct handling and storage of \nspecimens during transportation is essential for accurate diagnostic testing (see the Annex). Transport of \nspecimens should comply with any applicable national and/or international regulations, including the UN Model \nRegulations 23rd edition(44) and any other applicable regulations depending on the mode of transport being used. \nFor international transport, specimens from suspected, probable or confirmed mpox cases, excluding  viral isolates \nand cultures– should be transported in principle as Category B, UN3373 “infectious substance, affecting humans”, \nunless national regulations specify otherwise. (45,46)  \nAll specimens being transported should have appropriate triple packaging, labelling, and documentation. Shipping \nrequires a dangerous goods-certified shipper. For information on infectious substances shipping requirements, \nplease see the WHO Guidance on regulations for the transport of infectious substances 2023-2024.(45) \nSpecimen storage. Specimens collected for MPXV investigation should be refrigerated (2 to 8°C) or frozen (-20°C or \nlower) within one hour after collection. If transport exceeds 7 days for the specimen to be tested, specimens should \nbe stored at -20°C or lower. Longer-term specimen storage (>60 days from collection) is recommended at -70°C. \nViral DNA present in skin lesion material is relatively stable if kept in a dark, cool environment, which can be"

For a potential workflow see Figures 1 and 2. \nCommercial assays should clearly articulate what clades can and cannot be detected: ideally, targets should be \nconfidentially shared with regulatory authorities, and manufacturers should track potential target gene failure., and \nadvise end users if their assay is affected by a known target dropouts.(9,14) \n \nFigure 1: Laboratory testing algorithm for clinical management and surveillance of mpox: negative \nresults."

In the first, PCR reaction detects OPXV, but does not identify which species. This can then be \nfollowed by a second step, which can be PCR-based or use sequencing to confirm MPXV, specifically detect MPXV \nclades and, in the case of sequencing, lineages. Over the past year, several commercial PCR test kits detecting OPXV \nor specifically MPXV have become available, and performance evaluation studies have provided evidence on which \nof them have high sensitivity and specificity.(53,54) Positive control material for PCR assays can be ordered from \nspecialized initiatives (55). For best practice, the positive control should be included at a low concentration which is \nunequivocally above the limit of detection. Inclusion of quality control materials where possible can assist in \ncontrolling for any assay issues. Controls should provide information about (1) specimen quality, (2) nucleic acid \nquality, and (3) process quality. Because PCR can be extremely sensitive, efforts should be made to avoid \ncontamination, and negative controls should be used on every run to ensure contamination has not occurred. \nSpecimen integrity controls (e.g. RNase P), and extraction, positive and inhibition controls can help in \ndistinguishing a false negative from a true negative.

Virus isolation is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure and should only be performed in \nlaboratories with appropriate experience and containment facilities. The specific details for these methods are not \ncovered in this document because they are not recommended as part of routine diagnosis.  \nSerology. Antibody detection from plasma or serum should not be used alone for clinical diagnosis of mpox. MPXV-\nspecific antibody based tests are expected to face challenges of cross reactivity with antibodies to other \northopoxviruses as well as those elicited by  vaccination.(56,57) WHO therefore recommends that serology testing \nshould be restricted to reference laboratories until further evidence is available. Where a validated serological test \nis available in a reference laboratory, IgM detection from recently acutely ill patients or IgG in paired serum \nspecimens–collected at least 14-21 days apart, with the first being collected during the first week of illness, can aid \ndiagnosis if NAAT testing yields inconclusive results.  \nDisposal of waste. All waste that may contain MPXV should be decontaminated before disposal by using an \napproved method, such as autoclaving or chemical disinfection, according to approved laboratory and national \nprocedures.  \nPoint of care testing \nDNA detection. Point of care (POC) testing for MPXV is based on detection of nucleic acids, antigens and/or \nantibodies. Two molecular POC tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the United States Food \nand Drug Administration(FDA).(58) One detects DNA from MPXV (clade II only) and non-variola orthopoxvirus in \nhuman lesion swab specimens (59) and the other detects DNA from MPXV (clades I/II) in human lesion swab \nspecimens.(60) Both have been validated by manufacturers using an FDA-cleared real-time PCR test as the \nreference standard. The clinical validation was done using patient samples in the United States of America \n(confirmed PCR-positive for MPXV clade IIb only). Results of those evaluations are included in the instructions for \nuse,1 and they are comparable to the laboratory-based PCR reference standard. However, sample sizes are small, \nand there are no data on clinical or analytical performance reported in the peer-reviewed or pre-print literature at \nthis time. Independent clinical evaluation of POC molecular assays, including the FDA EUA products, is underway, \nand results will be soon published. WHO strongly encourages further research to determine the diagnostic accuracy \nand utility of such critical tools in settings where MPXV clades I and/or II circulate. If proven accurate and useful, \nthese products may be used when and where laboratory-based diagnosis is prohibitive due to lack of timely access \nto testing and/or when confirmatory diagnosis would influence clinical and public health decision making. WHO will \nissue an update to this guidance as soon as more evidence becomes available on their diagnostic accuracy. \nAntigen and/or antibody detection. Over the past year, antigen and/or antibody detection rapid diagnostic tests \nhave been commercialized.(61)There are no relevant published studies in the peer-reviewed or pre-print literature \nor products registered under emergency use listing/authorization as sources of data related to the performance of \nthese assays.  It is thus not yet known if they have sufficient accuracy to play a role in clinical management or \nsurveillance of mpox. A comparative evaluation including a small number of commercial antigen detection assays is \nunderway and includes settings where only clade I is known to circulate. Research to understand whether and how \nwell antigen tests can be used and with which specimens is also ongoing. MPXV-specific antibody-based tests are \nexpected to show cross reactivity with respect to other orthopoxviruses, including after vaccination with vaccinia-\nbased smallpox and mpox vaccines. Until further evidence is available, WHO does not recommend use of these tests \nfor diagnosis of acute or past infection with MPVX.  \nInterpretation of testing results  \nConfirmation of MPXV infection should consider clinical and epidemiological information.

Currently, the WHO mpox case \ndefinition considers an OPXV-positive case as a probable case.  \nA number of factors could contribute to false-negative results, such as poor quality of specimen, inappropriate \nhandling or shipping, or technical reasons inherent to the test, such as DNA extraction failure or operator error. In \nthe case of persistently high clinical suspicion and lack of an alternative diagnosis, repeat testing should be \nconsidered. Gene deletions may also lead false negative results (12,18) \nFor epidemiological purposes, WHO will propose case definitions for reinfection (updated surveillance guidance, in \npreparation) and these should be taken into consideration in test result interpretation. \nIn August 2023, Standing recommendations for mpox were issued by the Director-General of WHO in accordance \nwith the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).  These Standing recommendations call on all States Parties \nto include mpox as a notifiable disease in the national epidemiological surveillance system; to strengthen \ndiagnostic capacity at all levels of the health care system; to ensure timely reporting of cases to WHO, as per WHO \nguidance and case reporting form; and to share genetic sequence data and metadata through public databases.(62) \nGenomic sequencing  \nIn addition to the potential use of sequencing for diagnosis, genetic sequence data (GSD) may also provide valuable \ninformation to help understand the origins, epidemiology, and characteristics of the virus: for example, the origins \nof cases which are not part of the clade IIb B.1 lineage that gave rise to the 2022-2023 and ongoing multi-country \noutbreak or new strains emerging in countries where mpox is known to be endemic. (63,64) GSD for MPXV does not \nprovide the same resolution to track chains of transmission as it does for RNA viruses (such as Ebola virus).  \nNonetheless, a strategic and representative approach to sequencing of positive cases remains very valuable for \nunderstanding the epidemiology of mpox in a country. Targeted sequencing should be considered in specific \nsituations, such as for imported cases, re-infections, mutations leading to diagnostic failure or suspected enhanced \nhuman to human transmission, or vaccine breakthrough cases, and to assess for antiviral resistance.(65)  \nWHO strongly encourages countries and laboratories to share GSD, including raw data whenever possible, in a \ntimely manner through the available open access databases.  \nTesting for HIV \nPersons living with HIV who are immunosuppressed are at higher risk of developing severe mpox disease.(66) \nTherefore, most particularly where cases and outbreaks may be linked to sexual transmission or any circumstance \nwhere immune suppression may be suspected or known to be present, patients with mpox for whom HIV status is \nnot known should be tested for HIV per the current WHO consolidated guidance on HIV testing services.(29,67)  \nBiological risk management \nIt is recommended that all manipulations of specimens originating from suspected, probable or confirmed cases of \nmpox in the laboratory be conducted according to a risk-based approach. Each laboratory should conduct a local \n(institutional) risk assessment. When manipulating biological specimens, core biosafety requirements must be met \n(similar to those previously referred to as biosafety levels, see laboratory biosafety manual, 4th edition  2), and \nheightened control measures, indicatively equivalent to biosafety level 3, should be applied based on local risk \nassessment.(68) \nMPXV infection may be contracted during the specimen processing stage from contaminated material or faulty \nprocesses. Therefore, heightened biosafety measures are recommended in addition to core requirements. The \nfollowing measures should be included for the purpose of clinical testing without virus propagation: \n• \nSpecimens from persons who may have mpox must be handled in a functioning biosafety cabinet (Class I, II or \nIII) prior to specimen inactivation. Properly inactivated specimens do not require a biosafety cabinet.  \n• \nEach laboratory should ensure that local inactivation protocols have been validated. The UK Health Security \nAgency (UKHSA) has undertaken assessments of inactivation methods against MPXV.(69) \n• \nLaboratory personnel should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, especially for handling \nspecimens before inactivation.(29)"

These vaccines contain non-replicating (MVA-BN) or minimally-replicating (LC16, OrthopoxVac) \nstrains of vaccinia virus, an orthopoxvirus long used as a vaccine to prevent smallpox (declared eradicated in 1980). \nThe replication-competent vaccinia-based smallpox vaccine ACAM2000 or equivalent vaccines that meet WHO \nquality standards may also be considered.  \nAll vaccinia virus-based vaccines provide cross-protection against other OPXV, including against mpox. (36,70)  \nFor persons at risk of occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses, primary preventive (pre-exposure) vaccination \n(PPV) is recommended.(36) Therefore, national health authorities should conduct a risk assessment and consider \nimmunization for individuals who may be at risk based on their clinical susceptibility and exposure risk and the \navailability of vaccine.  This group may include health workers, laboratory personnel, persons working with wild \nanimals in the field or in veterinary laboratories and other persons who may be at risk of exposure to MPXV.  \nReporting of cases and test results \nLaboratories should follow national reporting requirements and be particularly attentive regarding confirmed cases \nwith a relevant recent history of international travel.(62). All MPXV test results, positive or negative, should be \nimmediately reported to national authorities and WHO as per the standard case reporting form. The standing \nrecommendations for mpox issued by the WHO Director-General in accordance with the International Health \nRegulations (2005) (IHR) outline current WHO recommendations for Member States.(62,71) Parties to the IHR are \nreminded of their obligations to share with WHO relevant public health information for events for which they \nnotified WHO, using the decision instrument in Annex 1 of the IHR (2005).(72) \nGlobal laboratory networking \nAccess to timely and accurate laboratory testing of specimens from cases under investigation is an essential part of \nthe diagnosis and surveillance of this emerging infection. Countries should strengthen diagnostic capacity at all \nlevels of the health system and at a minimum, should have access to reliable testing at national level or through \nreferral to laboratories in other countries that are willing and able to perform OPXV or MPXV diagnostics. WHO, \nthrough its Regional Offices, can assist Member States in accessing testing through referral. Where appropriate and \nsafely performed, inactivation of specimens in the local laboratory may facilitate referral and ease logistical \nchallenges. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the WHO Collaborating Centre for \nSmallpox and Other Poxvirus Infections (United States of America); and the Federal Budgetary Research Institution \n- State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, “VECTOR” (Russian Federation) is the WHO Collaborating \nCentre for Orthopoxvirus Diagnosis and Repository for Variola Virus Strains and DNA.  \nProcess and methods for guidance development \nThis document was prepared by WHO in consultation with subject matter laboratory experts with experience \nhandling and detecting MPXV and OPXV and individuals with expertise in public health virology and the \ndevelopment of diagnostic assays for OPXVs. \nThis emergency interim guidance was developed according to the standards and methods described in the WHO \neManual, XVII.2.10 Clearance of Interim Guidance During Graded Emergencies. In June 2023, the WHO Secretariat \nconvened an expert panel to review proposed updated recommendations to the interim guidance previously \npublished on 23 May 2022. For this latest update an expert panel meeting was held on 12 March 2024."

The WHO Secretariat held preparatory conference calls with five key \nexpert groups from various countries to identity and list key questions for which there was a need to review latest \nevidence. The Secretariat also reviewed and revised interim guidance documents for the mpox outbreak response \nto ensure relevant updates are noted and aligned. \nStep 2: Review evidence. A comprehensive search using one search string for each question was performed online \nvia PubMed. Because of the accelerated timeline and broad scope of the guideline, it was not feasible to undertake \na formal GRADE process (PICO questions; systematic reviews; formal documentation of values and preferences and \nincorporation of considerations of costs, resources, and feasibility).  \nStep 3. Convene expert group meeting. On 28 June 2023, WHO convened an expert group comprised of a \nmultidisciplinary panel of virologists, scientists, public health officials, and clinicians with experience in the \ndiagnosis of patients with emerging zoonotic diseases including orthopoxviruses. In preparation for this meeting, \nthe previous interim guidance was annotated and circulated to the panel.  \nStep 4: Prepare updated recommendations. The expert group was convened and was moderated by the WHO \nLaboratory Lead for the global mpox response. Draft recommendations were shared with the panel in advance and \ndiscussion was moderated until consensus was achieved. If there was no clear consensus, this was captured in the \ndraft document. The draft document was shared with the expert group in an iterative process for review. \nInformation on the instructions for use of the two point of care tests that have received FDA emergency use \nauthorization (EUA) approval was reviewed by WHO technical staff. Under confidential cover, WHO also reviewed \nmanufacturers’ submissions for FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) approval for both tests with FDA EUA.  \nStep 5: Review updated version. WHO updated the interim guidance to incorporate feedback from experts during the \nmeeting and circulated the updated version with the expert group as well as to all responsible officers for each \npillar of the WHO mpox response as well as with Regional Office laboratory focal points for mpox. \nStep 6: Publish and disseminate. The final document was submitted and approved for WHO executive clearance. \n \nPlans for updating  \nThis interim guidance incorporates the latest understanding and characteristics of the monkeypox virus and \naddresses questions and issues received from WHO Country and Regional offices and other channels. WHO \ncontinues to monitor the situation closely for any changes that may affect this document. Should any factors \nchange, WHO will issue a further update. Otherwise, this interim guidance document will expire two years after the \ndate of publication. \nContributors \nExternal contributors: Daniel Bailey, Claire Gordon, and Ashley Otter, UKHSA, UK; Janine Michel, Robert Koch \nInstitute, Germany; Chantal Reusken and Harry Vennema RIVM, Netherlands (Kingdom of the); Fabrizio Maggi and \nGiulia Matusali, Spallanzani Institute, Italy; Jacqueline Weyer, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South \nAfrica; Lateefat Amao, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria; Richard Njouom, Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, \nCameroon; Jean Bernard Lekana-Douki and Nadine N'dilimabaka, Centre international des recherches médicales \nde Franceville, Gabon; Christina Hutson, US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, Unites States of America; \nChristophe Batejat, Institut Pasteur, France; Supaporn Wacharapluesadee and Opass Putcharoen, Chulalongkorn \nUniversity, Thailand; Isabella Anna Eckerle, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, Switzerland; Francis Amirthanaj \nSelvaraj, Sheick Khalifa Medical University, United Arab Emirates; Clarissa Damaso, Federal University of Rio de \nJaneiro, Brazil; Daniel Bausch, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, Switzerland; Aytenew Eshete, Africa \nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention; Judith Wong, Raymond Lin and Lee Ching Ng, Ministry of Health, \nSingapore; Placide Mbala, Institut national de recherche biomédicale, Democratic Republic of the Congo; Pragya \nYadav, National Institute of Virology of the Indian Council for Medical, India; Jen Kok, New South Wales Health \nPathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Australia; Julian Druce; Victoria Infectious Disease \nReference Laboratory, Australia."
