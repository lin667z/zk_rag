Since \nthen most cases have been reported across Central and West Africa (1). MPX rashes can resemble various infectious \ndiseases such as varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus and syphilis. As of  6 June 2022, a total of 1002 laboratory-\nconfirmed laboratory-confirmed cases of MPX have been reported to WHO from 29 Member States from Europe and \nNorth America, across four WHO regions and no deaths have been reported. To date, the current MPX outbreak is \nmostly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and have predominately been identified amongst men seeking \ncare in primary care and sexual health clinics due to symptoms similar to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \nFor the most up-to-date case numbers see website ( ). \nDue to the multi-country nature of this outbreak, WHO has developed rapid interim guideline for the clinical \nmanagement and infection prevention and control (IPC) of MPX. See Section 1 on the methodology for more details. \nTarget audience\nThis document aims to provide interim guidance for clinicians, health facility managers, health workers and IPC \npractitioners including but not limited to those working in primary care clinics, sexual health clinics, emergency \ndepartments, dental practices, infectious diseases clinics, genitourinary clinics, maternity services, paediatrics, obstetrics \nand gynaecology, and acute care facilities that provide care for patients with suspected or confirmed MPX. For the \nentirety of this document, for ease, we will refer to patients that are being assessed and entering the MPX clinical care \npathway as suspects, which includes both epidemiological groups (suspected cases and probable cases)."

The initial content was derived from a draft version of the Monkeypox \nfield guide (unpublished, see acknowledgements) chapters on clinical care and IPC. These chapters were converted \ninto practical “straw-man” recommendations by the WHO Steering Committee, led by the Clinical Management and \nOperations Unit, and the IPC team, Country Readiness Strengthening Department, WHE. On 25 May 2022, the WHO \nSteering Committee was convened to agree on the scope of the guideline and the draft “straw-man” recommendations \nversion of the guidance. \nRelated guidelines: When possible, already published WHO guidelines were used to support rapid recommendations \n(see References). \nTiming: This is published as the Clinical management and infection prevention and control for monkeypox: interim rapid \nresponse guidance, with a proposed update 2 months from publication and conversion to a GRADE-based guideline \nthat adheres to standards for trustworthy guidelines. \nStepwise approach\nStep 1. Evidence monitoring: For the clinical recommendations, a comprehensive search was performed online via \nPubMed, using the following search criteria: “Monkeypox”, “Orthopoxvirus or Poxvirus” “Clinical outcomes” “Maternal \noutcomes” “Immunosuppression” and “Antivirals or therapeutic”. Randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, \nmeta-analysis, case reports and review articles were reviewed. Because of the accelerated timeline and broad scope \nof the guideline, it was not feasible to undertake a formal GRADE process (PICO questions; systematic reviews; formal \ndocumentation of values and preferences; and incorporation of considerations of costs, resources and feasibility). \nFor IPC recommendations, draft guidance was developed based on transmission-based precautions. This was circulated \nto an expert panel of IPC and infectious disease (ID) specialists which requested a rapid literature review be conducted. \nThe technical unit then conducted a rapid literature search on PubMed using the search strategy “Monkeypox”, \n“Orthopoxvirus or Poxvirus” AND “transmission”. Systematic reviews and relevant papers were included and reviewed. \nOn 25 May 2022 a consultation with IPC and ID experts from all WHO regions was held to discuss IPC measures and \nthe findings of the rapid literature search were shared at this meeting. On 24 May 2022, WHO hosted a clinical network \nmeeting to gather information about clinical characteristics and management from clinicians with recent experiences \nin the care of patients. \nStep 2. Convening the GDG: On 27, 28 and 30 May 2022, WHO convened an expert GDG comprised a multidisciplinary \npanel of health care providers with experience in the clinical management and IPC of patients with emerging zoonotic \ndiseases, HIV, STIs, as well as sepsis. In preparation for this meeting, the draft guidance was circulated to the panel \nalongside the primary references used in its development. The technical unit collected and managed declarations \nof interest (DOIs) and found no GDG member to have a conflict of interest. In addition to the distribution of a DOI \nform, during the meeting, the WHO Secretariat described the DOI process and an opportunity was given to GDG \nmembers to declare any interests not provided in written form. No verbal conflicts were declared. Web searches did \nnot identify any additional interests that could be perceived to affect an individual’s objectivity and independence \nduring the development of the recommendations."

Human \ndisease was first identified in 1970 in a 9-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and since then \nmost cases have been reported across Central and West Africa (1,2). There are two known clades of MPX, one in West \nAfrica (WA) and one in the Congo Basin (CB) region (5). Historically, the CB clade appears to be more virulent, with a \ncase fatality ratio (CFR) ranging from 1% to 10% (2,6,7), whilst the WA clade is associated with an overall lower mortality \nrate of < 3% (7,8). Recent data for the latter report a CFR of 1.4% (9). It is important to note that mortality in different \nsettings may differ substantially. \n2.2\t Natural history and disease severity\nThe incubation period of MPX is usually 6 to 13 days following exposure but can range from 5 to 21 days (10). Although \nmost people recover within weeks, severe complications and sequelae have been reported to be more common among \nthose unvaccinated for smallpox compared with those vaccinated (74% vs 39.5%) (11). It is unclear if there is waning \nimmunity to smallpox vaccination over time; however, studies indicate that smallpox vaccination is approximately 85% \neffective in preventing MPX (12). Since prior smallpox vaccination may result in a milder disease course, it is important \nto ascertain vaccination status in any person exposed to MPX (9). Evidence of prior vaccination against smallpox can \ntypically be found as a scar on the upper arm. Individuals over 40 to 50 years of age (depending on the country) may \nhave been vaccinated against smallpox prior to cessation of global smallpox vaccination campaigns after the WHO \ndeclared eradication of the disease in 1980 (1). Additionally, some laboratory personnel or health workers may have \nreceived the vaccine. \nTo date, most reported deaths have occurred in young children and immunocompromised individuals, such as those \nwith poorly controlled HIV (8,11,13). A recent study from the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that in a cohort \nof 216 patients, there were three deaths in patients < 12 years of age. When compared with survivors, patients with fatal \ndisease had higher MPX viral DNA in blood, maximum skin lesion count, and day of admission AST and ALT values (9). \n2.3\t Signs and symptoms\nMPX can cause a range of clinical signs and symptoms. The initial phase of clinical illness typically lasts 1 to 5 days, during \nwhich time patients may experience fever, headache, back pain, muscle aches, lack of energy and lymphadenopathy – \nwhich is a distinctive feature of this disease (9). This is followed by a second phase, which typically occurs 1 to 3 days \nafter fever subsides with the appearance of a rash (12,14,15). The rash presents in sequential stages – macules, papules, \nvesicles, pustules, umbilication before crusting over and desquamating over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. The lesions \nrange in size from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter and from a few to several thousand in number (1,2). The eruption tends to \nbe centrifugal, starting on the face and extending towards the palms and soles of the hands and feet, and can involve \nthe oral mucous membranes, conjunctiva, cornea and/or genitalia (2,11,16). Observations from current outbreaks \nin European and North American countries describe lesions starting in the genital area, but more information is"

Patients may develop lymphadenopathy – which was described in 98.6% of a cohort of over 200 patients \nwith MPX in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2,9). Oral ulcers are common and may affect a patient’s ability \nto eat and drink leading to dehydration and malnutrition (14,18). Inflammation of the pharyngeal, conjunctival and \ngenital mucosae may also occur (10,14). A recent large prospective observational study describing the natural history \nof 216 patients with MPX in the Democratic Republic of the Congo described the most common clinical symptoms to \nbe rash (96.8%), malaise (85.2%) and sore throat (78.2%). The most common findings on physical examination were \nthe classic MPX rash (99.5%); lymphadenopathy (98.6% – the cervical region was most frequently affected [85.6%], \nfollowed by the inguinal region [77.3%]); and mouth/throat lesions (28.7%) (9). \nThough uncommon, patients with MPX may develop severe and life-threatening complications. For example, the \nconfluence of skin lesions are susceptible to bacterial skin and soft tissue infections such as cellulitis, abscesses, \nnecrotizing soft tissue infections requiring meticulous local wound care; subcutaneous accumulation of fluid in the \ncrusting phase leading to intravascular depletion and shock; and exfoliation resulting in areas of skin that may require \nsurgical debridement and grafting (14,15,18). Other rarer complications include severe pneumonia and respiratory \ndistress, corneal infection which may lead to vision loss, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhoea which may lead to \nsevere dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and shock, cervical lymphadenopathy which may lead to retropharyngeal \nabscess or respiratory compromise, sepsis, septic shock, and, encephalitis and death (8–11,13–15).\nSmall studies looking at laboratory abnormalities in patients with MPX indicate that leucocytosis, elevated transaminases, \nlow blood urea nitrogen and hypoalbuminaemia were common features during illness, and that lymphocytosis and \nthrombocytopenia were seen in more than one-third of patients evaluated (2,9,18). \n2.4\t Differential diagnosis\nThe rash which develops in MPX may resemble other infectious diseases or other conditions, including varicella zoster \nvirus (VZV, chickenpox), herpes simplex virus (HSV), primary or secondary syphilis, disseminated gonococcal infection \n(DGI), foot and mouth disease, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), granuloma inguinale, molluscum \ncontagiosum, measles, scabies, rickettsia pox, chikungunya, zika virus, dengue fever, vasculitis and other bacterial skin \nand soft tissue infections. \nOften, the rash caused by VZV can be confused with MPX but can be distinguished as the rash in varicella generally \nprogresses quicker, is more centrally located than the centrifugal distribution of MPX, is in multiple stages of \ndevelopment (rather than the same stage as seen in MPX) and patients usually do not have lesions on their palms and \nsoles (2,11). Additionally, patients with VZV typically do not have lymphadenopathy, which is a hallmark of MPX (11). \nDespite the clinical differences between these two diseases, a study from the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nreported co-infection with MPX/VZV with an incidence of 10–13% (19,20). Patients with co-infection reported fatigue, \nchills, headache and myalgias. These individuals were less likely to report signs/symptoms of oral sores, axillary \nlymphadenopathy, cough or sore throat. Patients with co-infection had a higher lesion burden than seen with VZV \nalone but a lower rash burden than seen with MPX alone raising the suggestion that co-infection with these two viruses \ncould modulate severity of the overall infection – an area for further investigation (19,20)."

CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION\n2.5\t Transmission and viral shedding\nDespite decades of circulation in animals with occasional spread to humans, there are limited data available describing \ntransmission and viral shedding of MPX. Available information supports that transmission can occur from animal to \nhuman, human to human and from contaminated environments to humans. To date, most information is available \nfrom countries in West and Central Africa and less from areas in other WHO regions (18). \nMPX virus is transmitted from infected animals to humans via indirect or direct contact (12). Transmission may occur from \nbites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, cooking, playing with carcasses, or eating \nanimals, such as non-human primates, terrestrial rodents, antelopes and gazelles, and tree squirrels (14). The extent of \nviral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway (11). \n \nHuman-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or mucocutaneous lesions, this \nincludes face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact and respiratory droplets (and possibly \nshort-range aerosols requiring prolonged close contact) (2,21,22). The virus then enters the body through broken skin, \nmucosal surfaces (e.g. oral, pharyngeal, ocular and genital), or via the respiratory tract (21,23). The infectious period can \nvary, but generally patients are considered infectious until skin lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh \nlayer of skin has formed underneath. Transmission can also occur from the environment to humans from contaminated \nclothing or linens that have infectious skin particles (also described as fomite transmission). If shaken, these particles \ncan disperse into the air and be inhaled, land on broken skin or mucosal membranes and lead to transmission and \ninfection; one documented health worker infection has been published suggesting MPX virus transmitted through \ncontact with contaminated bedding (15,24). Persistence of surrogate pox virus in the environment and on different types \nof surfaces has been found to last between 1–56 days depending upon the temperature and room humidity (25,26); \nhowever, there are currently limited data on surface contamination and fomite transmission, aside from contaminated \nlinens (15). Pox viruses are generally more resistant to environmental conditions and show high environmental stability \n(25,26). During our literature search, no information on the presence of virus in wastewater was found. \nA recent study published in May 2022 from the United Kingdom has reported on the clinical characterization, viral \nkinetics and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and response to antivirals in seven patients infected with MPX \nbetween 2018 and 2021. All seven patients had MPX viral DNA detected by PCR in skin lesions and in upper respiratory \ntract samples; six patients had DNA detected in blood; four patients had DNA detected in urine and one person had DNA \ndetected in skin abscesses. Another recent study published in May 2022 on the clinical characterization of 216 patients \ndiagnosed between 2007 and 2011 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo suggested that MPX viral DNA in blood and \nthe upper respiratory tract may be detected prior to onset of rash and that peak viral load may occur very early in the \ndisease course (9). Data also suggest the MPX scabs contain significant quantities of viral DNA until and including when \nthey fall off and that it is higher than the levels found in the blood and throat (9). It should be noted that viral infectivity \nof specimens was not determined. At this time, the significance of these findings in relation to viral transmission and \ninfectious period remains uncertain (12). More information is needed to better understand other possible modes of \ntransmission and persistence via contact with other bodily fluids (such as breastmilk, semen, vaginal fluid, amniotic \nfluid or blood) and to better understand transmission by respiratory droplets and aerosols. \nIn the current outbreak countries and amongst the reported MPX cases, transmission appears to be occurring primarily \nthrough close physical contact, including sexual contact (oral, vaginal and anal)."

This suggests that MPX virus infection may lead to adverse outcomes for the fetus, such as death \nor spontaneous abortion (9,28). The association between severity of maternal illness and these outcomes is unclear (28,29). \n2.7\t Mid- and long-term effects\nMore information is needed about the clinical characterization of mid- and long-term effects of MPX. A study has \nreported > 90% of MPX survivors have no complications, regardless of smallpox vaccination status (14). Of those who \ndo develop long-term complications, most common sequelae are disfiguring scarring of the skin and blindness (11,14,30). \nPitted scars can develop called pockmarks (11,14). Data also suggest that patients may be at risk for developing mental \nhealth complications (15). \n2.8\t Summary of clinical care and infection prevention and \ncontrol\nCaring for patients with suspected or confirmed MPX requires early recognition of suspects, rapid implementation \nof appropriate IPC measures, testing of likely pathogens to confirm diagnosis, symptomatic management of patients \nwith mild or uncomplicated MPX and monitoring for and treatment of complications and life-threatening conditions \nsuch as severe dehydration, severe pneumonia and sepsis. The role of MPX-specific therapeutics remains experimental \nand can be used under RCTs (preferred) or expanded access protocols.

For example, during this outbreak, this \ncan be done at primary care clinics, sexual health clinics, emergency departments, infectious diseases clinics, \ngenitourinary clinics, dermatology clinics, maternity and paediatrics clinics and others. \n\t Depending on national (local) coordination pathways, telemedicine may be considered as a means of screening \npatients. \n\t Medical masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be available for patients presenting at screening areas. \nSigns should be posted for both respiratory hygiene and hand hygiene and instructions to put on a well-fitting \nmedical mask if any respiratory symptoms. \n\t Screening activities should be conducted maintaining a distance of at least 1 m from patients and using a \n“no touch” approach. Where these measures cannot be implemented or maintained then the facility should \nconduct a risk assessment to determine the level of PPE required according to the IPC recommendations for \nhealth facilities in the context of MPX (see Section 7 on IPC).

National or subnational health authorities \nmay recommend isolation in community or health facility based on their analysis of benefits and harms.\nClinical considerations: \n\t Decision to isolate and monitor a patient at home should be made on a case-by-case basis and be based on \ntheir clinical severity, presence of complications, care needs, risk factors for severe disease and access to referral \nfor hospitalization if condition deteriorates. \n\t Patients isolating at home should be ambulatory, have good food and water intake, be able to feed, bathe \nand dress themselves, and require minimal to no assistance from a caregiver. \n\t Those at higher risk for severe disease such as children, pregnant women or immunosuppressed patients should \nbe considered for admission to a health facility for closer monitoring due to concern for clinical deterioration.\n\t If vulnerable populations are living in the home setting and adequate IPC requirements cannot be met, \nconsider isolation in a health facility (36).

Empiric or prophylactic use of antibiotics should \nbe discouraged, as it increases the risk of emergence and transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria \nand places individuals at risk to possible side-effects of antibiotics such as Clostridium difficile associated \ndiarrhoea. Infections with MDR bacteria are more difficult to treat, and associated with increased morbidity \nand mortality (52–54). \n\t Secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions has been reported as a common complication of MPX and patients \nshould be monitored closely (10,13,16,21).\n\t A swab of a superficial skin infection is unlikely to be helpful unless the patient has had a prolonged \nhospitalization and there is concern for MDR organism. Signs of bacterial infection include erythema, \ninduration, warmth, worsening pain, a purulent drainage, malodorous discharge, or recurrence of fever. See \nAnnex 3 for oral options of antibiotics. In selected cases based on individual risk factors, known colonization \nand local prevalence, consideration may be given to initiate treatment for community-acquired methicillin-\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). \n\t Patients with bacterial superinfection of MPX rashes may develop an abscess which is the collection of pus \nwithin the dermis or subcutaneous tissue and most commonly due to bacteria from the skin (Streptococcus spp. \nand Staphylococcus spp.) (55). An abscess may appear as a painful, red, shiny nodule with or without fluctuance. \nThis may be associated with surrounding cellulitis, fever, and worsening pain at the site of infection.\n–\t Treatment of an abscess is incision and drainage done by sterile aseptic technique by a qualified health \nworker using appropriate IPC measures, to prevent complications related to untreated abscess such as \nosteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyomyositis, sepsis and shock. Depending on the location in the body (e.g. \nadjacent to major blood vessels), size and complexity of the abscess, the incision and drainage may need \nto be performed in the operating theatre.

It is available as immediate release oral capsules administered twice \ndaily for 14 days (65,70). An intravenous formulation was approved by the US FDA on 19 May 2022 (71). Preclinical \nstudies suggest tecovirimat was effective in non-human primates (15).\n\t A recent study from the United Kingdom described a patient who had blood and upper respiratory tract \nPCR negative 48 hours after starting treatment and remained PCR negative at 72 hours. Her haematological, \nrenal and liver profile remained within normal limits and she was discharged home to complete therapy (15). \nReported side-effects of tecovirimat include headache, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting (70,72). It is a \nweak inducer of cytochrome P450 and thus may have drug interactions with other medications metabolized \nthrough the same pathway (15,74). More studies are needed on safety and efficacy for the treatment of MPX in \nfield settings (15,74). \n\t Brincidofovir is approved by the EMA and FDA for treatment of smallpox and has been shown to have antiviral \nactivity against double-stranded DNA viruses, including poxviruses (73,75).

Implementing a hierarchy of controls is central to reducing the risk of exposure to \nMPX within health care settings. As such, considerations for the application of engineering and administrative controls \nand the use of PPE have been integrated throughout the recommendations outlined.\nIn countries where IPC programmes are limited or non-existent, it is critical to ensure that basic IPC standards are put \nin place at the national and health facility level to provide minimum protection to patients, health workers, caregivers \nand visitors and thereby protect the community. WHO provides guidance on the minimum requirements (82) for IPC \nat the national level and in health care facilities. Achieving the IPC minimum requirements and more robust and \ncomprehensive IPC programmes based on WHO Guidelines on core components of infection prevention and control \nprogrammes at the national and acute health care facility level ( ) across whole health systems is essential to sustaining \nefforts to control emerging infectious diseases, health care-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance (81). \nHealth workers should always follow standard precautions and perform a risk assessment to evaluate the need \nto use additional precautions.

The current list of procedures recognized by WHO as \naerosol generating includes aspiration or open suctioning of respiratory tract specimens, bronchoscopy, intubation, \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (99,100). ​\nAirborne infection isolation (precaution) room: A room with a high ventilation rate and controlled direction of \nairflow that can be used to contain airborne infections and acute respiratory infections caused by a novel agent with \nthe potential to pose a public health risk. Such rooms can be naturally or mechanically ventilated (99):\n\t Naturally ventilated airborne precaution room: the airflow should be directed to areas free of transit, or \nshould permit the rapid dilution of contaminated air into the surrounding areas and the open air; the average \nventilation rate should be 160 L/s per patient.\n\t Mechanically ventilated airborne precaution room: negative pressure is created to control the direction of \nairflow; the ventilation rate should be at least 12 air changes per hour (ACH). \nSuch a room is equivalent to the “airborne infection isolation room” described by CDC. \nAirborne transmission: The spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei that remain \ninfectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. Airborne transmission can be further categorized into \nobligate, preferential or opportunistic airborne transmission (99): \n\t Obligate airborne transmission: pathogens that are transmitted only by deposition of droplet nuclei under \nnatural conditions (e.g. pulmonary tuberculosis). \n\t Preferential airborne transmission: pathogens that can initiate infection by multiple routes, but are \npredominantly transmitted by droplet nuclei (e.g. measles and chickenpox).\n\t Opportunistic airborne transmission: agents that naturally cause disease through other routes, but under \nspecial circumstances may be transmitted via fine particle aerosols (101).\nDefinition from Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections in health \ncare (WHO, 2014). WHO will host a global consultation in 2022 to further review this definition.\nContact transmission: The spread of an infectious agent caused by physical contact of a susceptible host with people \nor objects. Direct contact transmission involves both a direct body-surface-to-body-surface contact and physical transfer \nof microorganisms between an infected or colonized person and a susceptible host. Indirect contact transmission \ninvolves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object (e.g. contaminated hands) that carries \nand transfers the microorganisms (99).\nDroplet transmission: The spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplets. Droplets are primarily \ngenerated from an infected (source) person during coughing, sneezing and talking. Transmission occurs when these \ndroplets that contain microorganisms are propelled (usually < 1 m) through the air and deposited on the conjunctivae, \nmouth, nasal, throat or pharynx mucosa of another person. Most of the volume (> 99%) comprises large droplets that \ntravel short distances (< 1 m) and do not remain suspended in the air. Thus, special air handling and ventilation are \nnot required to prevent droplet transmission (99)."

Countries currently reporting cases of \nthe West African clade are Cameroon and Nigeria; and of the Congo Basin clade are Cameroon, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo. With the case \ndefinition, all countries, except these four (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria) should report new cases of monkeypox as \npart of the current multi-country outbreak. Should countries of Central Africa identify any case of monkeypox due to the West Africa clade, these should also be reported."
