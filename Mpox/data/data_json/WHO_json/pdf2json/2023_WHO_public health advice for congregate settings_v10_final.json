Sometimes referred to as congregate settings, these \nare a range of contexts and facilities where people are living in \nclose proximity to one another, often in large numbers. These \nsettings commonly contain shared spaces such as bathrooms, \nsleeping spaces, kitchens and common areas; and/or shared \nitems such as cutlery, bedding and clothing. \nThis public health advice from WHO provides \ninformation about reducing the risk, spread and impact \nof mpox (also known as monkeypox) in settings in which \npeople live in proximity (referred to throughout this \ndocument as congregate settings). It will be updated \nas more is known about how this infection can spread \n(even from a single case) in different settings and \ncontexts. \n \nThe information in this tool should be adapted based on \nthe risk level and needs of your community and setting. \nIt is intended to be used as a basis for keeping people \ninformed, identifying local solutions, driving formal \nand informal community conversations and information \nsessions, or producing information for your communities \non how to protect themselves and others.\n20 March 2023\nExamples of congregate settings include facilities such as \nprisons, jails, youth detention, migrant detention, refugee \ncamps and reception facilities, nursing homes, transitional \nhousing, dormitories, and university campus housing. In 2022, \nthere were reported cases of mpox from a range of congregate \nsettings and contexts. \nAlthough these settings are extremely varied, they all share \na common factor in which some or many people are living \ntogether or coming into close contact with one another, and as \nsuch, all pose a risk for transmission of mpox. \nSometimes given the realities and vulnerabilities associated \nwith life in these settings, people may be at risk of health \ncomplications if infected with mpox.  \n \nThis document will use the term congregate settings to refer to \nall settings where people live, work or stay in proximity to one \nanother.  \nConsiderations for different kinds of congregate settings can be \nfound at the end of this document.\nThis tool is based on our current understanding of the transmission of mpox virus and infection, \nprevention and control.

If cases present in your \nfacility, react without being judgmental or making any assumptions about the circumstances \nregarding the infections. \nStigma negatively affects those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, family, friends, \nand communities. Stigma and discrimination related to mpox may intersect with existing \nstigma and discrimination linked to other factors in congregate settings such as ethnicity, race, \nor sexuality. \nIt may be helpful to train your staff on mpox, stigma and discrimination to encourage \nadherence to proposed public health measures aimed at protecting your whole community. \nUnderstanding existing patterns and identifying things that have worked in the past to reduce \nstigma and discrimination will be useful. \nKey points for consideration:\n•\t Focus communications on activities and  – not the people - that are fuelling the outbreak. \n•\t Emphasize the fact that mpox spreads between people through close contact.

Anyone who has close \ncontact with someone who is infectious is at risk. \nOutbreaks of monkeypox in newly affected \ncountries have mostly been identified in communities \nof gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with \nmen who have had recent sexual contact with a \nnew partner or partners. Communities of trans and \ngender diverse people linked to the same sexual \nnetworks have also been affected. \nWhile the risk is not limited to these groups, the \noutbreak has become an additional focus for stigma \nand discrimination directed against men who have \nsex with men, trans people and broader lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex communities \nand their families. Similarly, stigma, discrimination \nand other expressions of racism towards \ncommunities from previously affected regions \nhas increased as a result of the new outbreak of \nmonkeypox.\nStigma and discrimination connected to any \ndisease, including monkeypox, are never \nacceptable. They can have a serious impact on \nhealth outcomes and undermine the outbreak \nresponse by making people reluctant to come \nforward or seek care. This increases the risk of \ntransmission – both within the most affected \ncommunities and beyond.  \nThe impact of stigma and discrimination on \nthe monkeypox outbreak must be mitigated \nthrough active strategies to prevent people \nbeing unable or unwilling to access health \nservices and support and to create an enabling \nenvironment where people feel able to report \ntheir symptoms. \nThis public health advice from WHO provides information on the potential impact of stigma, \nrecommended language and actions to counter stigmatizing attitudes and discriminatory \nbehaviours and policies related to the monkeypox outbreak. It will be updated as more is known \nabout effective strategies against stigma and discrimination in the context of this outbreak. \n1 September 2022\nA note before we start \nPeople often stigmatize others without being \naware that they’re doing it, and without any \nmalicious intent. People automatically make \njudgments about others without realizing how \nit might affect them. In fact, most people have \nfelt ostracized or been treated like a minority \nat some time in their lives. We all find ourselves \nperpetuating harmful stereotypes or falling back \non unconscious biases at times. Being aware of \none's own unconscious bias is important, but even \nmore important is to not allow those implicit biases \nto cause discrimination to be enabled or ignored.\nProactively reflecting and acting on our own \nlanguage, behaviour and intentions as individuals \nand as agencies is essential to reducing the \nharm caused by stigma and discrimination. \nHaving good intentions is not enough – this \ninterim guidance is for everyone working on or \nconcerned by monkeypox. Fear of perpetuating \nstigma and discrimination should not stop \nindividuals and organizations from speaking up \non important issues; the most important thing we \ncan do is to be reflective, seek feedback, call out \nstigma and discrimination where we see it and be \nopen to learning and changing our behaviour. \nPREVENTING AND MANAGING MPOX IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS \nIt is important to remind the communities in which \nwe work that having or being exposed to mpox is \nnothing to be ashamed of.

Examples include the setting up of an additional tent next \nto the family tent. In this case, a person with an infectious condition such as mpox for which isolation is recommended can reduce \nthe risk of passing on the infection to family members, while still remaining in proximity for their physical needs such as meals and \nemotional support. \nIn these contexts, it is important to facilitate realistic public health and social measures for mpox, including infection prevention and \ncontrol, to stop the spread of disease in the facility.\nKey context-specific activities: \nRemember to consider mpox when an \noutbreak of rash and fever illness occurs. \nEnsure access to testing for people who \npresent with symptoms of mpox through \navailable health services.\nCoordinate with the relevant authorities to \ncontrol rodents or small mammals in the camp.\nEnsure oversight and risk assessment of \nactivities related to purchase or procurement \nof bush meat.\nCollaborate with health authorities to \npromote dissemination of accurate and \nnon-stigmatizing information\nIf possible, provide a space for isolation of \ninfectious disease cases with the availability \nof critical WASH infrastructure (water \nsupply, sanitation, waste management) - \nthis is very critical to limiting the spread of \ninfectious disease.\nEnsure active case search is undertaken \nto find additional suspected mpox cases \nin camps. This can be done by workers or \nvolunteers and must be conducted with respect \nto confidentiality and local context specific \nsensitivities.\nWork with camp authorities and healthcare \nproviders to strengthen the capacity to identify \ncases of mpox and carry out contact tracing.\nConsider how such critical work can be \nintegrated with other essential community \nhealth activities in the camp.\nEmphasise and implement realistic infection \nprevention and control measures such as:\n•\t Providing adequate hygiene supplies \nsuch as soap, water, or alcohol-based \nrub\n•\t Ensuring health and community workers \nare equipped with adequate PPE\n•\t Encouraging the careful handling and \nthorough cooking of foods containing \nanimal parts or meat in areas where \nanimals carry mpox \n•\t Encouraging the regular and effective \nenvironmental cleaning and disinfection"

These tools aim to help provide some considerations for camp coordination, cluster and other humanitarian response \nnetworks to discuss, adapt and integrate. \nThe Collective Service for RCCE has tools to help with coordination. Visit: www.rcce-collective.net.\nCommunications and engagement: \nWhere mpox risk is high or of concern: convene \ncommunity dialogues to understand the key \nconcerns around mpox. Make a plan together \nto respond to these concerns and maintain \nengagement through community networks in the \ncamps. \nEnsure discussion includes other health problems \nin the camp so that people feel their concerns are \nbeing heard\nEstablish community feedback mechanisms that \nallow these most-at-risk groups to share their \nopinions and voice their complaints\nActivate networks of civil society \norganizations, camp health workers, \ncommunity volunteers and influential \ncommunity voices to share accurate, \ncontextualized and non-discriminatory \ninformation about mpox\nHelp ensure community and healthcare \nworkers can maintain a connection with \npeople who have been infected with mpox \nand can guide them on where to seek care\nProtection priorities: \nEnsure that people infected with mpox are not excluded from ongoing humanitarian assistance such as food and health \nsupplies and protection support.\nEnsure that children with mpox receive the best possible standard of care and nutrition, including Vitamin A \nsupplementation, oral rehydration, skin care, and pain relief as needed, to support full recovery without complications. \nEnsure that people with mpox also have access to HIV testing and care.\nSpecial attention should be given to groups at high-risk including pregnant women, children, elderly, people who are \nimmunocompromised and persons with disabilities. Adapt messaging and engage community networks (including \nthrough community health workers, and antenatal clinics) to effectively reach these groups with accurate information \nand support. \nTaking care of residents with mpox:\nEncourgae them to \nstay hydrated, eat \nwell, and sleep. \nKeep rash dry \nand uncovered \nwhenever possible \nfor optimal healing, \nand covered when \nothers are present\nEnsure proper \nskin and eye care.\nKeep rash clean \nwith sterilised \nwater/antiseptic \nRinse lesions \nin the mouth \nwith salt \nwater\nUse paracetamol \nto manage the \ndiscomfort of \nlesions, if needed\nAdvise them to use \nmedication for pain \nand fever if needed \nand available.\nEncouraging hand hygiene \n(cleaning hands) before \nand after touching lesions \nusing soap and water or an \nalcohol-based hand sanitizer"

In other settings, consensual and \nnon-consensual sex, pose increased risk for \nthe potential spread of mpox. In cases of \nnon-consensual sex there’s no opportunity for \nopen conversation between partners about \npossible risks and symptoms.\nThis is a supporting tool to accompany the public health advice for congregate settings with specific recommendations on \nadapting the advice for dormitories with particular focus on university campuses and other residential settings.\nInformation about mpox is evolving rapidly.
