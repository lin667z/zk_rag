It is intended for \nuse by sex workers, sex worker–led organizations, owners \nand managers of sex-on-premises venues, community \nleaders, advocates, organizations focused on addressing \ngender-based violence, health-care providers (especially \nthose delivering sexual health care) and organizations \nworking to promote the health of sex workers.\nThe information in this document can be used as a basis \nfor formal and informal community conversations, infor­\nmation sessions or producing community information to \ninform sex workers and their clients on how to protect \nthemselves and others. By following these recommen­\ndations and advice, sex workers can reduce their risk of \nacquiring and spreading mpox, safeguard their health \nand access necessary health care and support.\nThe information included here can and should be adapt­\ned to the local context and sex work setting, depending \non the needs and risks.\nOverview\nMpox is a viral infection that is spreading in many coun­\ntries. Anyone in close contact with someone infectious \nis at risk, but some people have an increased risk from \nmpox and should take additional precautions to protect \nthemselves and their friends and their families from the \nvirus.\nSex workers face unique challenges that increase their \nrisk of exposure to mpox, which requires offering clear, \npractical and accessible guidance to help to protect their \nhealth and the health of their clients.\nWe know that this outbreak is concerning, especially for \npeople who are unwell, their partners, families and com­\nmunities and for people whose professions require close \ncontact with others, including sex workers. Many sex \nworkers will struggle financially if they are unable to work \neither by avoiding close contact with clients who have \nmpox or while isolating because they have suspected or \nconfirmed mpox. Sex workers may also be at increased \nrisk of violence, for example, if they refuse to engage in \nsex during the outbreak.\nThis issue is likely to be especially acute if there is little or \nno social or other types of protection, such as childcare \nor financial support available.\nSome sex worker–led organizations established mutual \naid schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which sup­\nported sex workers’ livelihoods when they needed to take \na pause from work to care for themselves or their families \nor to limit contact with clients. Similar schemes may be \npossible in your location. Identifying, establishing and \nraising awareness about these schemes is essential to \ncreate an environment in which sex workers can protect \nthemselves, their families and communities.\nThis document is based on current understanding of the \ntransmission of mpox and related infection prevention \nand control measures. It aims to provide useful, com­\nmon-sense advice for timely response to mpox out­\nbreaks. This advice may evolve as new evidence becomes \navailable. Keep up to date at www.who.int."

In most countries, \nmpox outbreaks result from human-to-hu­\nman transmission.\nIn developing interventions with your com­\nmunity, understanding the local modes of \ntransmission well is essential. Where mpox is \nendemic in certain places in Africa, it can also \nspread through animal-to-human contact \nsuch as when hunting or preparing wild \ngame for consumption as food. This can lead \nto further spread in the family or community. \nOr it can spread through touching the same \nclothing, bedding, towels, objects, electron­\nics, surfaces or sex toys used by someone \nwho has mpox. Mpox can cause a rash and \nother symptoms such as enlarged lymph \nnodes, fever, headache, muscle aches, back \npain and low energy.\nHaving or being exposed to mpox is nothing \nto be ashamed of. Anyone can get mpox. \nLet’s take care of each other and get rid of \nmpox together.\nCondoms prevent some sexually transmit­\nted infections but will not protect you from \nacquiring mpox through close physical con­\ntact. If used correctly, condoms may reduce \nexposure to mpox and the severity of genital \nor anal symptoms.\nTo protect yourself and others:\n\t●\nKnow the symptoms and check yourself \nregularly.\n\t●\nHave open conversations with close \ncontacts.\n\t●\nAvoid close contact with someone who \nhas mpox or is showing symptoms.\n\t●\nDo not use bedding, towels, clothing \nor any personal items that might have \ncome into contact with a person who \nhas mpox.\n\t●\nSeek health advice and get tested if you \nhave been exposed or have symptoms.\n\t●\nConsider limiting the number of sexual \npartners if this is realistic.\n\t●\nIf you think you may have mpox, avoid \nsexual activity and close contact with \nothers until you have been tested and \nevaluated by a health-care provider.\n\t●\nGet vaccinated if an mpox vaccine is \navailable to you."

Anyone who has close contact with an \ninfected person can get mpox and may be able to spread \nthe virus to others. \nSymptoms \nIf you are exposed to someone with mpox you should \nwatch for such symptoms as:\n\t●\nrash\n\t●\nfever\n\t●\nheadache\n\t●\nswollen lymph nodes\n\t●\nmuscle aches\n\t●\nback pain\n\t●\nlow energy.\nThe rash can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of \nthe feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. It may also \nbe found in the mouth, throat, anus, rectum or vagina or \non the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to \nseveral thousand.\nSymptoms most often develop within a few days of expo­\nsure but can develop up to 21 days (about three weeks) af­\nter being exposed to someone with mpox. Complications \nfrom mpox can include severe pain, skin or lung infections \n(pneumonia), confusion and eye problems. Other compli­\ncations include inflammation or sores around the genitals \nand rectum. Mpox can lead to loss of pregnancy or severe \nillness of the baby, scarring or depigmentation of the skin \nor blindness. In some cases, mpox can be fatal, especially \nfor infants, young children or people with a weakened \nimmune system.\nHow mpox spreads\nMpox spreads through close contact with someone who \nhas mpox, for example:\n\t●\nskin-to-skin contact (such as touching or vaginal or \nanal sex);\n\t●\nmouth-to-mouth contact (such as kissing);\n\t●\nmouth-to-skin contact (such as oral sex or kissing the \nskin);\n\t●\nface-to-face contact (such as talking or breathing \nclose to one another); and\n\t●\ntouching the same clothing, bedding, towels, objects, \nelectronics, surfaces or sex toys\nPeople with mpox are considered infectious until all their \nlesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off, a new \nlayer of skin has formed underneath and all the sores \non the eyes and in the body (in the mouth, throat, eyes, \nanus, rectum or vagina) have healed. This can take several \nweeks, during which the person should consult a local \nhealth-care provider and isolate from others to protect \nthem from becoming infected.\nMpox and HIV\nPeople with underlying immunodeficiencies may be at \nhigher risk of severe mpox.\nPeople living with HIV who achieve viral suppression \nthrough antiretroviral therapy do not appear to have \na higher risk of severe mpox than the general popula­\ntion. Using daily effective HIV treatment (antiretroviral \nmedicine) reduces the risk of severe mpox symptoms if \ninfected.\nPeople with untreated HIV infection or advanced HIV \ndisease may be immunocompromised and therefore have \na greater risk of severe mpox and death."

If you have new and \nunusual rashes or sores, avoid having sex or any other \nkind of close contact with other people (if this is possible) \nuntil you have been checked for sexually transmitted \ninfections and mpox by a health-care provider. Remember \nthat the rash can also be found in places that can be hard \nto see, including the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina, anus \nor rectum.\nHave open conversations\nHave open, non-judgemental conversations with close \ncontacts, partners and clients if this is safe. If appropriate \nand possible, swap contact details so that you can tell \neach other if symptoms develop, even if you were not \nplanning to see each other again. Combat misinformation \nby sharing only reliable, evidence-informed and non-stig­\nmatizing information from trustworthy sources.\nAvoid close contact\nIf possible, avoiding close contact with family, friends, \nhousemates, partners or clients who have confirmed or \nsuspected mpox can effectively reduce your risk.\nClean regularly\nClean your hands regularly using soap and water or an \nalcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wash clothing, bedding, \ntowels, objects and surfaces more often than usual. Con­\nsider changing towels and bed sheets between clients, if \npossible. Use detergent and water, ideally hot water. Clean \nobjects, surfaces, sex toys and electronics more often than \nusual with soap and water and household disinfectant.\n\nGet tested\nIndividuals exhibiting symptoms of mpox who do not \nknow their HIV status should be encouraged to get tested \nfor HIV while getting tested for mpox. Testing for coinfec­\ntion, including for HIV and sexually transmitted infections, \nshould be considered routine clinical practice in sexual \nhealth services, and standard local guidance should be \nfollowed.\nGet vaccinated\nIf it is available, get vaccinated against mpox. This pro­\nvides extra protection in addition to the other measures \nlisted here. Remember that vaccines take several weeks \nto become effective, and no vaccine offers 100% protec­\ntion. You may still transmit the virus to others after being \nvaccinated.\n\nConsider other risk-reduction approaches\nOne way to reduce your risk of mpox is to consider reduc­\ning the number of sexual partners, if this is realistic.\nUse condoms. Condoms will not fully protect against \nmpox but may reduce the risk or extent of exposure and \nwill help to protect you and others from HIV and other \nsexually transmitted infections.\nThe virus has been found in semen, but whether mpox can \nbe spread through semen or vaginal fluids is currently not \nknown. People with mpox are advised to use condoms for \n12 weeks (about three months) after they recover.\nThe long read\nHow to reduce your risk of mpox"

Sex-on-premises venues can include \nsaunas, sex clubs, bathhouses, tolerance houses or \nbusinesses with back rooms and dark rooms; events refer \nto both private and commercial sex-on-premises events. \nSpecial considerations and precautionary measures are \nnecessary for venues and events where there is sex on the \npremises to reduce the risk of mpox for personnel, people \nattending venues or events and communities.\nHere is practical advice to help reduce the risk of mpox \ntransmission in sex-on-premises venues. It is intended to \nbe adapted to your specific needs and can be used as a \nbasis for community conversations, information sessions \nor producing community information for your communi­\nties:\n\t●\nClients who have had confirmed mpox should not \nhave sex or close contact while they have active \nsymptoms and then should use condoms for 12 \nweeks following recovery.\n\t●\nSex workers working in organized premises should \nbe supported to safely deny sex if they have concerns \nabout possible transmission. Give sex workers clear \ninformation and support about how to safely refuse \nsex with clients or insist on condom use. Displaying \nmessages that clearly state that any aggression or vio­\nlence toward sex workers or other clients will result in \neviction and a ban can help to create a safe environ­\nment if appropriately enforced.\n\t●\nDevelop a plan for how to support clients who be­\ncome infected with mpox during or after attending \nyour premises, including providing details about \nrelevant health-care services.\n\t●\nInform personnel and volunteers about how to \nprotect themselves and others against mpox, the \nsymptoms and what to do if someone at an event or \nvenue develops symptoms.\n\t●\nDevelop a plan for how to support sex workers and \nother personnel if they get mpox through their work. \nThey need support to take time to recover.\n\t●\nIdentify where clients can be referred for mpox test­\ning or vaccination in your community.\nHaving or knowing someone with mpox can be distress­\ning. If someone within your community tells you that they \nhave mpox, react without being judgemental or making \nany assumptions about how they have become infected. \nRespect their wishes as to whether they want other people \nto know about their illness.\nSome sex workers face stigma or discrimination in their \ndaily lives. Stigma and discrimination towards any group \nor because of any disease is never acceptable."
