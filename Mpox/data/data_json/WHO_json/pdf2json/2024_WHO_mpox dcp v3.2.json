Implementing a \nhierarchy of controls is central to reducing the risk of exposure to mpox within health \ncare settings.  As such, considerations for the application of engineering and \nadministrative controls and the use of PPE are recommended.  \nHealth workers should always follow standard precautions and perform risk \nassessments to evaluate the need to use transmission based precautions.  \nCleaning and Waste Management\nPPE should be worn by healthcare \nworkers while cleaning and \ndisinfecting patient care equipment \nand patient areas.This will require \nGloves (heavy duty), gown, respirator, \nand eye protection.

Standard sample collection safety precautions recommended.  The test can be \nperformed under core biosafety requirements similar to those under biosafety level 2, \nwith heightened control measures applied based on local risk assessment. \nFor lesion material, swabs can be transported dry in capped tubes or placed in viral \ntransport media.  All specimens collected for\nlaboratory investigations should be regarded as potentially infectious and have have \ntriple packaging, labelling, and documentation when transported.
