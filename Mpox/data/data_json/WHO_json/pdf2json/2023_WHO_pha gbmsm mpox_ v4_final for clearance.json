                "page_content": "What you need to know about mpox\nHow to reduce your risk of mpox\nIn the newly affected countries, mpox is mostly \naffecting some gay, bisexual and other men \nwho have sex with men through sexual contact. \nHowever, anyone who has close contact with \nsomeone with mpox can get it. Transmission can \nalso occur through respiratory droplets (such \nas through kissing, coughing or sneezing) and \ncontact with contaminated materials, such as \nbedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces.\nSymptoms\nIf you are exposed to someone with mpox you \ncould develop symptoms up to 21 days afterwards. \nThe most common symptoms include:\n•\t\nRash\n•\t\nSwollen lymph nodes\n•\t\nFever\n•\t\nHeadache\n•\t\nMuscle aches\n•\t\nBack and rectal pain\n•\t\nLow energy \nThe rash looks like blisters or sores in the skin, \naffecting the face, palms of the hands, soles of \nthe feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. These \nlesions may also be found in the mouth, throat, \nanus, rectum or vagina, or on the eyes. The \nnumber of sores can range from one to several \nhundred. Some people develop inflammation \ninside the rectum that can cause severe pain \n(proctitis). Severe complications may include \nbacterial infection of skin lesions, mpox affecting \nthe brain (encephalitis) or lungs (pneumonia), and \neye problems. \nHow mpox spreads\nAmong humans, mpox spreads through close \nphysical contact with someone who has mpox, for \nexample:\n•\t\nSkin-to-skin contact (such as touching or \nvaginal/anal sex)\n•\t\nMouth-to-mouth contact (such as kissing)\n•\t\nMouth-to-skin contact (such as oral sex or \nkissing the skin)\n•\t\nFace-to-face contact (such as talking, brea-\nthing or singing close to one another)\n•\t\nTouching the same clothing, bedding, \ntowels, objects, electronic gadgets or \nsurfaces \nIn some settings, mpox can also spread from an \nanimal carrying the virus to a person. People with \nmpox can be infectious for several weeks, at least \nuntil all the lesions and sores in their bodies have \nhealed. Skin lesions are healed when they have \ncrusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new \nlayer of skin has formed underneath. During the \nrecovery process, it is recommended that people \nwith mpox self-isolate to protect others from \ngetting this illness.\nSexual health, HIV, and mpox\nIf you think you are at risk or have been diagnosed \nwith mpox, you may benefit from testing for sex-\nually-transmitted infections (STIs) from trusted \nservices. This includes testing for HIV if you do not \nknow your status. If you are HIV negative, discuss \nwith your health care provider whether you would \nbenefit from taking HIV PrEP. \nIf you are living with HIV, continue to take your HIV \nmedication as directed, if it is accessible to you. If \nyou think you may have mpox, seek advice from a \ntrusted health worker. People living with HIV who \nachieve viral suppression through antiretroviral \ntreatment are not at any higher risk of severe \nmpox.\nEvidence suggests that immunosuppressed \npeople, including people with untreated HIV \nand advanced HIV disease, are at higher risk of \ndeveloping severe mpox and death. Symptoms \nof severe mpox include larger, more widespread \nlesions (especially in the mouth, eyes, and \ngenitals), secondary bacterial infections of the \nskin or blood and lung infections. The data shows \nworst symptoms in people who are severely \nimmunosuppressed (with CD4 count less than \n200 cells/mm3). \nPeople whose immune system is weakened, such \nas those with undiagnosed or untreated HIV, are \nat risk of more severe mpox if they are exposed. \nMany people living with HIV know their status, \nare well-controlled on treatment and reach HIV \nviral suppression. This means that their immune \nsystems are less vulnerable to other infections \nthan they would be without treatment. \nSevere mpox cases seen in some countries \nhighlight the urgent need to increase equitable \naccess to mpox vaccines and therapeutics, and \nto HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Without \nthis, most affected groups are being left without \nthe tools they need to protect their sexual health \nand wellbeing. \nKnow your own risk\nKeep up to date about the risk of mpox in your \narea and in your community. Check yourself \nregularly for symptoms, particularly if you \nhave new or multiple sexual partners or have \nrecently engaged in group sex or chemsex (use \nof recreational drugs during sex). If you have new \nand unusual rashes or sores, you should avoid \nhaving sex or any other kind of close contact with \nother people and seek medical advice.\nRemember that the rash can also be found in \nplaces that can be hard to see inside the body, \nincluding the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina, anus \nor rectum, and people may have this infection \nwithout knowing.\nManage your risk\nAvoiding close contact with people who have \nmpox is the most effective way to avoid catching \nit. If someone you live with has confirmed or \nsuspected mpox, there are some simple steps \nyou can take to protect yourself. Avoid being in \nthe same room as someone with mpox, including \nsharing linens and beddings, and keeping objects \nand surfaces clean. Wash your hands frequently \nwith soap and water or an alcohol-based hand \nrub. Avoid sharing personal items including \nbedding, towels, utensils, and electronic devices. \nMonitor yourself for symptoms of mpox for 21 days \nafter your last close contact with someone with \nmpox, and avoid sexual contact with others.\nIf mpox is being transmitted in your area and you \nare sexually active, you can take steps to reduce \nyour risk of being exposed. You may choose \nto reduce the number of  sexual partners you \nhave. If you do have sex with someone new, you \ncan consider having open and non-judgmental \nconversations about the risk and whether any of \nyou have current symptoms, if it is safe to do so. \nConsider swapping contact details with your close \ncontacts so that you can let each other know if \none of you gets mpox. \nCondoms prevent some STIs. They will not protect \nyou from acquiring mpox through close physical \ncontact. If used correctly, condoms may reduce \nexposure to mpox, and the severity of genital or \nanal symptoms.\nGet vaccinated\nSome countries are offering vaccination for mpox. \nIf this is available to you, WHO recommends that \npeople who are at high risk of being exposed to \nmpox get vaccinated. This includes gay, bisexual \nand other men who have sex with men with \nmultiple sexual partners. Getting vaccinated if \nyou are eligible provides you with an extra level \nof protection in addition to the other measures \nlisted here. Remember that vaccines take several \nweeks to take effect, and no vaccine offers 100% \nprotection. Continue to protect yourself and others \nfrom mpox, even after being vaccinated."

                "page_content": "If you are having sex with multiple partners, seek regular screening for sexually transmitted infections and \ntake PrEP where it is available. Seeking health advice regularly and quickly, if you have symptoms, will help \nyou get treatment if needed and avoid you infecting anyone else.\nRemember - condoms may not prevent mpox  \nbut can prevent other sexually transmitted infections.\nWhat to do if you have suspected or confirmed mpox\nTake care of your physical and mental health. \nHaving or being exposed to mpox is nothing to be \nashamed of. \nSeek advice and get tested\nIf you have been in contact with someone with \nconfirmed mpox and have no symptoms, contact \na health worker for advice. Monitor closely for \nsymptoms if you have been exposed. Some people \nmay be able to transmit mpox before symptoms \nshow, so avoid sexual contact with other people \nif you have been exposed to mpox, regardless of \nwhether you have symptoms or not. \nIf you have symptoms of mpox, contact a health \nworker for advice, testing and medical care. \nSelf-isolate where possible while waiting for a \ntest and avoid close contact with others. Mention \nto your health care provider that you think your \nsymptoms could be mpox. Don’t allow fear of \njudgment to stop you from getting the support \nyou need. Stigma can stop people from accessing \nservices and makes it harder to end outbreaks. .\nRecovering from mpox\nIf you do test positive for mpox, you will need to \nisolate from others until your rash has healed. \nThis will help protect anyone else from getting \nthis infection. Your healthcare provider will give \nyou advice on how to take care of yourself. Keep \nhydrated, eat well and get enough sleep. Use \nmedication for pain and fever if needed. Take care \nof your rash:\n•\t\nAvoid scratching\n•\t\nKeep lesions dry\n•\t\nClean rash with sterilized water/antiseptic\n•\t\nRinse lesions in your mouth with saltwater\n•\t\nTake warm baths with baking soda/Epsom \nsalts\n•\t\nUse paracetamol to manage fever and \npain, if needed\n•\t\nUse lidocaine to manage discomfort of oral \nand perianal lesions\nKeep in touch with a health worker and seek \nimmediate advice if your rash becomes more \npainful, or if it shows signs of being infected (such \nas fever, redness or pus). You should also seek \nadvice if your pain, fever, nausea or vomiting \nget worse, if you are unable to eat or drink, have \ndifficulty breathing or if you feel dizzy or confused.\nCommunicating with recent contacts\nIf you have had close contact (including sex) with \nanyone in the previous 21 days, consider telling \nthem about your diagnosis so that they can be \nalert to symptoms and get tested, if possible. \nHealth workers might be able to help you pass \non the information to your previous contacts \nanonymously if you do not feel able to do so.\nProtecting other people\nIf you have mpox, you will need to self-isolate \nuntil you can’t pass it on. Your healthcare provider \nwill help you decide if you should be cared for \nin hospital or at home. This will depend on how \nserious your symptoms are, whether you have \nrisk factors that put you at risk of more serious \nsymptoms, and whether you can minimize the risk \nof passing it on to anyone you live with. If you are \nisolating at home, protect others you live with by:\n•\t\nIsolating in a separate, well-ventilated \nroom (e.g. with windows that can be \nopened frequently) \n•\t\nUsing a separate bathroom, or cleaning \nafter each use \n•\t\nClean your hands with soap and water or \nan alcohol-based hand rub frequently\n•\t\nClean and disinfect surfaces after using a \nshared space\n•\t\nUsing separate utensils, towels, objects, \nelectronic gadgets and bedding \n•\t\nWaste that is generated such as banda-\nges, gloves and masks should be placed \nin strong bags and securely tied before \ndisposal\n•\t\nDoing your own laundry, and putting \nmaterials in a plastic bag before carrying it \nto the washing machine.  \nIf you can’t avoid being in the same room as \nsomeone else, avoid close contact with other \npeople and your pets, wash your hands often, \ncover your rash with clothing or bandages, and \nwear well-fitting medical masks. Avoid close \ncontact with other people and pets in the home. \nSince it is possible that mpox can be spread \nthrough semen or vaginal fluids, people who have \nrecovered from mpox are advised to use condoms \nwhen having all forms of sex for 3 months \nfollowing recovery of mpox infection. \nAvoiding and addressing stigma and \ndiscrimination\nHaving or knowing someone with mpox can be \ndistressing. If someone within your community \ndiscloses to you that they have mpox, react \nwithout being judgmental or making any \nassumptions about how they have become \ninfected. Respect their wishes as to whether they \nwant other people to know about their illness or \nnot. Do all you can to help those self-isolating, \nincluding doing their shopping and checking in \nwith them regularly. Fortunately, most people will \nrecover fully within three weeks of their infection. \nGiving people an opportunity to talk about their \nconcerns and feelings can also help. Encourage \nthem to take care of their mental health, to eat \nwell, stay hydrated and do exercise if possible.\nWhere can I learn more about mpox? \nFind answers to some of the most common \nquestions on mpox here, read other pieces of \nWHO public health advice, or read the WHO \nfactsheet. Check your local official and community \nsources for updates on the situation near you. \nMany organizations supporting gay, bisexual and \nother men who have sex with men, including \nHIV support organizations around the world, are \nalready providing strong leadership in offering \ninformation and support to their communities to \nhelp prevent the spread of mpox. Their work, also \nincreasingly supported by broader LGBTQIA+ \norganizations, is central to efforts to address \nstigma and discrimination as well as information \nsharing.
