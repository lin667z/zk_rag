Doctor Salam is joining us from WHO’s office in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. Welcome, Doctor Salam. Doctor Salam, mpox as a viral disease has been around for decades, what is different about this outbreak to trigger this declaration a public health emergency of international concern? "

In 2022, an outbreak erupted and became global, when the disease spread to many countries that had never seen the virus before. What is happening in 2024 is a large number of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo including the appearance of a new virus strand clade Ib, which is spreading fast from person to person. Unlike the outbreak in 2022, where it was affecting mostly men who have sex with men, this time it is affecting everybody, women, men and children. "

When a sick person is speaking very close to another person who is not sick, they may have some micro particles that are infectious. Another transmission way is from animal to human, during the hunting, skinning or cooking of the animal. The third transmission way is through contaminated objects, such as sheets, towels and needles. Finally, the transmission may be vertical through a pregnant woman to the fetus or the baby. "

Those vaccines, if well used, can help to stop the chain of transmission. But they are not the only way to stop the chain of transmission. If we do an appropriate surveillance with early detection of cases and we make a monitoring of the contacts of those cases, when they get sick, we isolate them very quickly and we give them appropriate treatment and also when we make sure that those who do not have any symptoms are taking very simple measures, like washing hands.
