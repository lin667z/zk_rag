The\n\n    guidance also addresses considerations for clinical management such as the use of therapeutics, nutritional support, mental health services and post-infection follow up. \nThe document provides guidance for clinicians, health facility managers, health workers and infection prevention and control practitioners including but not limited to those working in primary care clinics, sexual health clinics, emergency departments,\n\n    infectious diseases clinics, genitourinary clinics, dermatology clinics, maternity services, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and acute care facilities that provide care for patients with suspected or confirmed mpox."

        "page_content": "On 23 July 2022, the WHO Director-General declared the escalating global mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\n\n \n[1]\n The temporary recommendations state (Section 2.e.iii), “When the use of vaccines and antivirals for mpox in the context of a collaborative research framework is not possible, use under expanded access protocols can be considered, such as the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Experimental Interventions (MEURI),\n\n\n \n[2]\n under certain circumstances, using harmonized data collection for clinical outcomes (such as the WHO Global Clinical Platform for Mpox)”. \nIn April 2022, WHO updated its ethical framework to guide the \nEmergency use of unproven clinical interventions outside of clinical trials\n. The framework has three major\n\n    ethical categories, each with specific criteria that need to be met for it to be permissible to use a clinical intervention outside of clinical trials. \nIn the context of the current multi-country mpox outbreak there are global efforts underway to gather evidence on the use of novel antivirals such as tecovirimat and their benefit within the clinical course of mpox disease.  \nWhile there is not yet sufficient evidence to inform clinical management guidelines,  WHO has developed the\nemergency use protocol for tecovirimat for mpox under the MEURI framework\n. This framework supports two objectives:\nTo provide access to tecovirimat to patients with mpox during the multi-country outbreak while clinical trials cannot be immediately initiated, maintaining ethics and regulatory oversight; and ensuring data monitoring, reporting, and sharing.   \n\n        \nTo characterize the clinical characteristics of the cohort including the monitoring of any adverse or serious adverse events during the drug course and description of time to lesion resolution. \nThis emergency use protocol complies with all the predefined criteria for the use of unproven clinical interventions. \nWHO encourages Member States using tecovirimat to participate in the emergency use protocol under the MEURI framework.\n[1]\n \nWHO Director-General's statement at the press conference following IHR Emergency Committee regarding the multi-country outbreak of mpox - 23 July 2022\n[2]\n \nEmergency use of unproven clinical interventions outside clinical trials: ethical considerations (who.int)\n[3] Emergency use protocol for tecovirimat for mpox under MEURI framework (protocol ID; CERC.0179), V-1.0\nTitle \nEmergency use protocol for tecovirimat for mpox under MEURI framework \nInvestigational product \n \nSIGA Technologies, Inc.

The \nMEURI ethical framework\n makes provision for the emergency use of unproven clinical intervention outside of clinical trials. \nFor mpox, the initiative provides access to tecovirimat during the multi-country outbreak, pending the availability of evidence from randomised clinical trials. MEURI maintains ethics and regulatory oversight, and ensuring data monitoring, reporting, and sharing. The use of tecovirimat within this framework can be recorded using the \nWHO Global Clinical Data Platform for mpox\n which allows collection of anonymised patient data, and will contribute to our understanding of the clinical characteristics, variation and associations of mpox disease. The Atlas will support those collecting data to harmonise their assessments of lesions, and improve the quality of the collected data.\nThe Atlas may also be beneficial to the wider medical community as a teaching and learning resource, including in dermatology and sexual health clinics. It is one of many such resources, and it should be noted that this is not a comprehensive tool, nor does it focus on atypical lesions or those relating to other disease processes.\n"
