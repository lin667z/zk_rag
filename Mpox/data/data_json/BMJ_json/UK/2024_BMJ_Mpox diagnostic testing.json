We recommend that 2 samples are taken for each patient to ensure sufficient material for confirmatory testing. Follow the instructions below: 1. Ensure that you are wearing the minimum appropriate PPE as above. 2. Take a viral swab in viral culture medium or viral transport medium (for example Virocult®) from an open sore or from the surface of a vesicle. If other wounds are present, ensure that the sample is definitely taken from a vesicle, an ulcer or a crusted vesicle. Rub the swab over the lesion and place the swab in the collection tube. If there are pharyngeal lesions, a throat swab should also be taken. Label the tube with the patient’s name and date of birth, the date and site of the sample. Note that unlabelled tubes cannot be processed. 3. A viral throat swab can be taken for high-risk contacts of a confirmed or highly probable case who have developed systemic symptoms but do not have a rash or lesions that can be sampled. Please note that even if the throat swab is negative, the individual must continue with monitoring and isolation as instructed by their local health protection team, and should be reassessed and sampled if further symptoms develop. 4. Other samples (blood, semen, scabs) should only be sent if directed by the IFS. 5. For suspected HCID cases, urgent local testing for MPXV can be done in Containment Level 3 per local risk assessment; however, in order to ensure timely clade testing, samples should be sent concurrently to the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL). If local testing is positive, this ensures that samples are already in RIPL for urgent clade testing. If local testing is negative, testing can be cancelled, or other testing (for example for rickettsial infection) can be done more quickly. If MPXV testing is not provided locally, the laboratory should also forward the samples urgently to RIPL for MPXV PCR. 6. Samples for investigation of other infections, including sexually transmitted infections, should be packaged separately, with separate request forms for local testing. 7. Samples should be sent to your normal local laboratory. If HCID mpox is suspected, please alert the laboratory to arrange for urgent processing, and to organise for samples to be sent to RIPL via a Category B courier. Category A is not required either for suspected or confirmed mpox samples, unless transporting viral cultures. This is per the Department for Transport Multilateral Agreement M347 under section 1.5.1 of ADR on the carriage of MPXV. Clinicians should remember that infections such as chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV), molluscum contagiosum and syphilis are all still circulating and may present with similar lesions. Diagnostic testing for these infections should be undertaken as usual, with testing following normal local procedures."

                "page_content": "There is a body of evidence documenting the detection of RNA and DNA viruses in semen after acute infection. MPXV DNA has been detected in semen up to day 11 after acute infection in men in Italy, although longitudinal sampling after this point was not carried out. It remains unclear whether this is from seminal carriage as the testes are immunologically-protected sites (as with other viral infections such as Ebola virus disease), or from resolving meatal or urethral lesions that disappear as the skin lesions resolve. However, in view of this, current UKHSA advice takes a cautious approach and recommends that men who have had a confirmed or highly probable diagnosis of mpox according to the UKHSA case definition should use condoms during sex for 12 weeks after complete recovery from mpox infection. This is in line with advice from the World Health Organization (WHO). It should be recognised that there is currently no evidence to support this or any alternative advice. Following the initial 12 weeks and up to 6 months after recovery from infection, UKHSA recommends performing MPXV PCR   on semen samples (and where necessary, oropharyngeal and/or rectal swabs) if the patient: \n  is undergoing fertility treatment or planning pregnancy\n  is undergoing planned semen storage (for example prior to chemotherapy)\n  has an immunocompromised sexual partner (including a pregnant partner)\n  is concerned about transmission to sexual partner or partners for any other reason and requests a test from their clinician\n Testing can also be offered on patient request following discussion with the local infection or genitourinary team and then with RIPL. A single negative PCR after 12 weeks post recovery is considered adequate, with recognition that this is based on expert opinion in the absence of a clear evidence base. It should also be noted that a positive PCR does not necessarily indicate that the patient is potentially infectious, only that fragments of DNA have been detected. However, since viral culture is not feasible for clearance testing, if the PCR is positive it is prudent to consider the patient potentially infectious. Repeat samples should be submitted every 2 weeks thereafter, and the patient should continue to use condoms until a negative test result is obtained. Any samples sent without a minimum serial interval of 2 weeks will not be processed without prior discussion with RIPL. Any testing that is requested prior to 12 weeks post recovery must first be discussed and agreed with RIPL prior to sending. Samples received without discussion will not be processed. For semen tested prior to 12 weeks post-recovery, 2 samples collected at least 48 hours apart should be tested, and both need to be negative to be deemed clear. Sample collection must take place in a facility capable of arranging transport of a Category B sample. These are usually hospitals where cases of mpox are cared for and not genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Samples should be submitted in a universal sterile container and sent to the RIPL address in the Submitting diagnostic samples to RIPL for testing section. Samples must be packaged and sent as a Category B infectious substance. Please ensure that samples are properly packaged and sealed. Leaking samples will not be processed. Samples will only be tested during working hours Monday to Friday. Please include a completed MPXV testing request form stating interval post infection as outlined above. Appropriate counselling from clinicians should include that this is an unvalidated diagnostic test. It is expected that evidence will emerge for duration of MPXV DNA detection in semen which will allow this guide to be updated, and earlier testing may be offered if the evidence supports this."

These exposures can be avoided if standard biosafety precautions are taken. It is important that other diagnostic testing is not delayed while waiting for the results of MPXV testing so as not to delay diagnosis of other illness that may require urgent treatment. Other procedures, such as extraction or procedures which may generate aerosols, should be performed in a CL3 facility with staff wearing cuffed, back-fastening gowns, gloves and goggles. For PCR testing of specimens from suspected mpox cases (for example testing for syphilis or HSV), the specimens should be opened in an appropriate microbiological safety cabinet in a CL2 facility. Samples can be inactivated before extraction by heating for 1 hour at 60°C in a validated water-bath or block designed to ensure even heat distribution throughout standard specimen tubes. Guanidine/guanidinium buffers such as AVL can also be used but work best with additional non-denaturing surfactants (see Inactivation of orthopoxvirus for diagnostic PCR analysis by Vinner and Fomsgaard, and PAHO/WHO guidance). Information on inactivation studies performed by UKHSA on some commonly used sampling buffers for mpox is available. Inactivated samples can be handled safely with standard laboratory precautions. Samples from confirmed and highly probable mpox cases should be labelled appropriately so that laboratories can ensure that they are handled correctly with the necessary additional precautions as outlined above. For routine testing of blood samples from suspected or confirmed mpox cases (for example for biochemistry or haematology), standard clinical laboratory precautions can be followed, but aerosol generating procedures should be avoided. The risk of infection from these samples is less than that for hepatitis B or any other similar organism. Surfaces should be decontaminated with standard disinfectants. Waste should be autoclaved and disposed of as per standard laboratory procedures."

                "page_content": "UKHSA provides a primary diagnostic testing service and a clade confirmation service. The primary diagnostic service is chargeable, except for suspected HCID cases referred through the IFS. Clade confirmation is not charged for; however, you will be charged if you do not state clearly on the form that the sample has already tested positive and that only clade confirmation is required. UKHSA does not restrict NHS or private laboratories from establishing their own MPXV testing service, but any such service would be provided at their own expense. Please note that all laboratories, including private laboratories, must forward samples from positive cases to RIPL for clade confirmation. Laboratories planning on establishing local diagnostic testing should ensure they remain compliant with relevant legislation, perform appropriate risk assessments, and assure ongoing quality. Laboratories should be aware that MPXV is schedule V restricted by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Laboratories should also ensure that their testing provision is able to maintain compliance with the different operational definitions of HCID for mpox within their testing pathways, including the ability to distinguish or escalate for confirmation cases that may be classified as an HCID. UKHSA does not approve, endorse or recommend a specific commercial MPXV diagnostic test, although an MPXV-specific nucleic acid amplification test is recommended, and use of an orthopox-only test is discouraged. The use of multi-target assays is recommended. Reports of genomic deletions in assay target regions that may result in false negatives have been reported. Similarly, the recently reported clade Ib strain lacks the PCR target for the standard clade I assay and may be misidentified by the usual clade tests. Please discuss the case with RIPL if you suspect you have a case with an assay target dropout (for example orthopox positive/MPXV negative). At present, only nucleic acid amplification tests (typically PCR-based) are recommended for provision of testing services. Other test types are available on the market, however their performance characteristics in this outbreak are uncertain and are not recommended by UKHSA. A list of tests on the commercial market is maintained by FIND. Recommended process prior to testing To ensure confidence and compliance with the current notifiable diseases regulations, it is recommended that UK laboratories follow the process outlined below prior to commencing with an mpox testing service. 1. Submit a copy of their nucleic acid assay verification file and reporting criteria for peer review to the UKHSA mpox Diagnostics team (contact details below), along with the intended go live date and predicted capacity. 2. Technical specialists at UKHSA Porton Down will provide a peer review that assay selection is reasonable for the service offered and remove the need for confirmatory testing of positive samples by RIPL. This peer review is not an assay approval and laboratories should ensure they follow their standard local assay approval processes including through relevant accredited bodies. 3. Laboratories should work with their UKHSA regional laboratory surveillance Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) leads to ensure data feeds from their laboratory systems are reporting correctly to SGSS data system. 4. For monitoring purposes, laboratories should provide both MPXV negative and positive results into SGSS. 5. It is critical that data collection and reporting systems are in place and tested with mpox data analytics teams before the service goes live to ensure this feeds into the national surveillance programme. 6. A turnaround time within 24 hours from sample receipt, and preferably same day, is desirable. If a laboratory intends to provide testing using an alternative testing methodology, please contact the UKHSA mpox Diagnostics team (contact details below) to discuss prior to offering the service, as this may have significant implications for public health monitoring purposes. UKHSA Porton Down may be able to supply control material to assist in assay verification activities (contact through the UKHSA mpox Diagnostics team, see below). External Quality Assurance (EQA) providers are providing mpox proficiency schemes for laboratories to assure their testing services. \n  UKHSA mpox Diagnostics team contact details: ripl@ukhsa.gov.uk\n"
