                "page_content": "Mpox is an infectious disease that is caused by infection with a virus called  MPXV .\\nMpox was  first discovered in 1958  when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ), and since then the infection has been reported in a number of African countries. Prior to 2022 most cases were reported from the  DRC  and Nigeria. In 2003, mpox was recorded in the US  when an outbreak occurred following the importation of rodents from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet exposed to an imported animal and all patients recovered. There are 2 major genetic groups (clades) of  MPXV , clade I (formerly known as Central African or Congo basin clade) and clade II (formerly known as West African clade). Clade I is split into clade Ia and clade Ib. Clade II is split into clade IIb and clade IIa, with subgroup clusters called lineages. The majority of the cases seen in the outbreak in 2022 were from clade IIb, lineage B.1. Since May 2022, cases of human mpox have been reported in multiple countries that have not previously had  MPXV  in animal or human populations, including the UK. The majority of these cases are from clade IIb, lineage B.1. Since January 2023, clade II mpox is no longer considered a high consequence infectious disease ( HCID ) within the UK. Clade I mpox remains an  HCID . There is  further information on the  HCID  status of mpox  available. Further information on the epidemiology of mpox is available in the  mpox epidemiological overview . Clade I  MPXV  has previously been intermittently transmitted from animals to humans, with small mammals and primates acting as hosts. Clade I  MPXV  can also spread via human-to-human transmission and had previously been associated with close contact. However, in March 2023, infections linked to sexual contact and international travel were reported in the  DRC  for the first time. Historically, clade I mpox was known to circulate in 5 Central African Region countries: \\n   Cameroon \\n   Central African Republic (CAR) \\n   the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) \\n   Gabon \\n   the Republic of the Congo \\n In 2024, clade I mpox cases were reported from countries beyond these 5 Central African Region countries. This is likely to be because of multiple factors including waning population immunity from the discontinued smallpox vaccine and changing environmental and social factors, but the full aetiology remains unclear. See the  countries affected by clade I mpox ."

                "page_content": "Mpox does not spread easily between people unless there is close contact. Spread between people may occur through: \\n   direct contact with rash, skin lesions or scabs (including during sexual contact, kissing, cuddling or other skin-to-skin contact) \\n   contact with bodily fluids such as saliva, snot or mucous \\n   contact with clothing or linens (such as bedding or towels) or other objects and surfaces used by someone with mpox \\n It is possible that clade I mpox may spread between people through close and prolonged face-to-face contact such as talking, breathing, coughing, or sneezing close to one another. However, there is currently limited evidence so this will be updated as new information is available. Spread of mpox may also occur when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal (rodents are believed to be the primary animal reservoir for transmission to humans), or materials contaminated with the virus. Mpox has not been detected in animals in the UK."

                "page_content": "The incubation period is the duration/time between contact with the person with mpox and the time that the first symptoms appear. The incubation period for mpox is between 5 and 21 days. Mpox infection is usually a self-limiting illness and most people recover within several weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.  HCID  mpox is known to cause more severe disease than non- HCID  mpox clades with case fatality rates of 10% reported in non-vaccinated individuals previously. The illness begins with: \\n   fever \\n   headache \\n   muscle aches \\n   backache \\n   swollen lymph nodes \\n   chills \\n   exhaustion \\n   joint pain \\n However, not all people who have mpox experience all of these symptoms. Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body including the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. Lesions can also affect the mouth, genitals and anus. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming scabs which eventually fall off. Some individuals may not have a widespread rash, and in some cases only genital lesions are present. These may be blisters/vesicles, scabs or ulcers. An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material. Areas of erythema and/or skin hyperpigmentation are often seen around discrete lesions. Lesions can vary in size and may be larger than those shown. Lesions of different appearances and stages may be seen at the same point in time. Detached scabs may be considerably smaller than the original lesion."

A definite diagnosis of mpox requires assessment by a health professional and specific testing in a specialist laboratory. In the UK, testing is provided by many NHS laboratories, and is also available at the  Rare and imported pathogens laboratory ( RIPL )  at the UK Health Security Agency ( UKHSA ) Porton Down. Patients with a travel or exposure history indicating possible  HCID  mpox should be discussed with the  RIPL  clinical team as soon as possible via the 24/7 Imported Fever Service helpline (0844 778 8990). All samples from all individuals testing positive for mpox must be sent to  RIPL  for clade differentiating tests. Samples from suspected and confirmed cases of mpox should be shipped as Category B diagnostic samples. See  guidance on diagnostic testing  for information on how to submit samples for testing."

Antiviral drugs such as cidofovir and tecovirimat can be used to treat mpox patients with severe disease or those who are at high risk of severe disease. Smallpox vaccine can be used to support the control of outbreaks of mpox. People vaccinated against smallpox in childhood may experience a milder disease. Vaccines have been used to protect high risk individuals during outbreaks."

Scabs are also infectious and care must be taken to avoid infection through handling bedding and clothing. Information on infection prevention and control measures are available in the  NHS guidance on infection prevention and control measures for clinically suspected and confirmed cases of mpox in healthcare settings . Mpox virus is classified as an  ACDP  Hazard Group 3 pathogen  and all laboratory work with live virus must be conducted at full Containment level 3 ( CL3 ), in accordance with the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended).   See the  guidance on diagnostic testing  for further information on handling specific sample types. Laboratories must ensure that appropriate controls commensurate to  CL3  are in place to minimise risk to laboratory workers so that they can safely perform laboratory tests that are essential to clinical care."
