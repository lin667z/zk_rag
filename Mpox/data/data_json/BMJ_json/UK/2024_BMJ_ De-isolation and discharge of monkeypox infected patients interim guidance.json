If there is any doubt, clinicians should discuss virological testing of persistent lesions with the UKHSA Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory ( RIPL ). Transfer of patients from an isolation unit in one hospital to an isolation unit in another hospital may be necessary in certain circumstances prior to the patient meeting all of the above criteria. Such arrangements must be made following case-by-case discussion and agreement between specialists at both institutions."

                "page_content": "Patients meeting the  clinical ,  laboratory  and  lesion criteria  as stated above can be discharged from hospital to home without requirement for ongoing isolation (that is, full de-isolation). Patients meeting the  clinical criteria  but not meeting either  laboratory  or  lesion  criteria may be discharged from hospital to continue isolation at home where it is safe to do so after assessment by their treating clinician. They must be able to isolate away from any members of their household who are: \\n   children aged under 12 years \\n   pregnant women \\n   immunosuppressed individuals as per  green book definition \\n \\n They must not go to work, school or public areas and should avoid close contact with other people in their household. For patients with HCID mpox, the safety of this approach must be discussed and agreed with the HCID network and the health protection team (HPT) on a case-by-case basis, including an agreed plan for monitoring clinical progress and criteria for deisolation. Patients with any lesions should remain in regular contact with their clinician until all lesions have crusted over and all scabs have dropped off. Ongoing contact may be required after de-isolation. Complex and severe cases, with slow clinical and virological resolution may require additional specialist guidance on risk management following discharge from hospital on a case-by-case basis. Patients should be given clear safety-netting guidance, including resources detailing what expected symptoms are and how to treat these. They should also map out what the concerning symptoms to look out for are, and when, where and how to escalate and get help at all time periods. Symptom diaries and strategies for monitoring progress and recovery should also be shared, including where appropriate monitoring tools, for example thermometers, oximeters. There is  guidance available for people diagnosed with non-HCID mpox who have been advised to isolate at home , which includes information on resuming sexual activity."

                "page_content": "This guidance relates to patients who have been diagnosed with clade II mpox only, and either managed at home throughout their illness, or who have been discharged from hospital to isolate at home. There are 2 stages to de-isolation of patients in household settings. Patients are able to end self-isolation at home once the following lesion criteria have been met. The following criteria must all be met: \\n   there have been no new lesions for 48 hours \\n   there are no oral mucous membrane lesions \\n   all lesions have crusted over \\n   all lesions on exposed skin (including the face, arms and hands) have scabbed over, the scabs have dropped off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath \\n   lesions in other areas should remain covered throughout the patientâ€™s time outside of their home or when in contact with other people \\n Patients should continue to avoid close contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and children aged under 12 years until the criteria for full de-isolation are met (see  stage 2  below). This means patients should continue to be excluded from work if their work requires close contact with any of these groups. They should be advised to speak to their employer before returning to work as a risk assessment may be required for people who work in vulnerable settings and consideration given to redeployment or continued exclusion until the criteria for full de-isolation are met. The patient can resume full normal activities with no restrictions when they meet the following lesion criteria: \\n   there have been no new lesions for 48 hours \\n   there are no mucous membrane lesions \\n   all lesions (for both exposed and unexposed areas) have crusted over, all scabs have dropped off, and intact skin remains underneath"
