                "page_content": " \n \n MPXV  is a virus from the same family as smallpox, that presents with a rash illness which may be mild and localised, or severe and disseminated. There are 2 distinct clades of the virus: Clade I and Clade II. Clade II  MPXV  is responsible for the global outbreak that began in 2022. Clade I  MPXV  is currently considered more severe than Clade II  MPXV , leading to its classification as a high consequence infectious disease ( HCID ). Historically, Clade I  MPXV  has been reported only in 5 Central African countries. However, recent cases in additional countries within Central and East Africa mark the first known expansion of its geographical range, heightening the risk of spread beyond the region. Evidence of sustained sexual transmission of Clade I  MPXV  has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ). Healthcare professionals should remain vigilant for Clade I  MPXV , including in sexually acquired mpox cases, and should obtain comprehensive travel histories from patients. The symptoms of mpox begin 5 to 21 days (average 6 to 16 days) after exposure with initial clinical presentation of fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and headache. Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face or genital area and it may then spread to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off. Treatment for  MPXV  is mainly supportive."

Clinicians treating patients with suspected mpox who may meet the operational case definition of an  HCID  (as outlined above) should discuss this with local infection specialists. Infection Specialists should discuss all possible Clade I  MPXV  cases with the  UKHSA  Imported Fever Service ( IFS ) on 0844 778 8990 so that testing can be expedited. Patients with severe disease (who do not meet the operational case definition) should also be discussed with the  IFS .   Individuals with clinically suspected mpox presenting to acute care settings who meet the case definition for possible Clade I  MPXV  infection should be isolated and managed as a  HCID  as outlined in the NHS guidance on the  Infection prevention and control measures for clinically suspected and confirmed cases of mpox in healthcare settings . In outpatient settings, individuals presenting with clinically suspected mpox who meet the case definition for possible Clade I  MPXV  infection should be isolated appropriately (single room, closed door) and clinical staff should wear face fit tested FFP3 masks, eye protection, long-sleeved splash resistant gowns and gloves to provide care if immediately required. Where suspected cases meeting the operational case definition present in primary care, General Practitioners should isolate the patient in a single room and contact their local infection service for advice, including appropriate arrangements for transfer into secondary care and immediate precautions in the setting. All samples from all individuals testing positive for  MPXV  (regardless of whether there are potential links to Clade I or travel from the African region) must be sent to the  UKHSA   RIPL  for clade differentiating tests.  UKHSA  will contact Trusts for samples for any mpox cases for which samples have not been received for clade typing.   Cases of confirmed Clade I  MPXV  infection will be managed through the specialist network of  HCID  centres. UKHSA ’s  mpox resource collection   will be kept up to date with information on affected areas for the duration of the outbreak to assist NHS clinicians in diagnosis."
