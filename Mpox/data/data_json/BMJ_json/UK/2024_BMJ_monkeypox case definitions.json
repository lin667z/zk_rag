Clade II mpox has been circulating in the UK and globally since 2022 predominantly in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, but remains uncommon. It is no longer classified as an  HCID . Clade I mpox is currently classified as an  HCID . It includes clade Ia, present in central Africa, and clade Ib, currently causing an outbreak in multiple countries (see the  affected country list ). Consider the possibility of mpox when patients with exposure risk and which fit the clinical description in the section on  When to suspect mpox . When assessing patients for mpox, always consider the possibility of  HCID  and take a travel history. If the patient fits the  HCID  case definition , they should be  managed as potential  HCID  and discussed with local infection team, who may refer to the  Imported Fever Service ."

Consider common infections such as chickenpox or shingles, herpes simplex virus, and enterovirus in the differential diagnosis; these circulate widely and are more common than mpox; exclude as appropriate."

All suspected cases undergoing testing should be  notified  to the  local health protection team  by the clinician. The managing clinician should contact their relevant local infection team (infectious diseases, microbiology, or virology). The local infection team should then discuss with the  IFS  (0844 778 8990) who will review risk assessment and advise on the next steps for investigation and  management  including the need for admission. If a decision is made to test,  information on diagnostic testing for mpox  is available. The managing clinician should contact the  local health protection team . Test for  MPXV , the causative agent of mpox (using designated testing pathway). See also  Mpox diagnostic testing guidance . Undertake tests to rule out alternative diagnoses if clinically appropriate and if not done already. If patient requires admission for clinical reasons,  IPC  measures should be undertaken as per the  NHS guidance on  IPC  measures for clinically suspected and confirmed cases of mpox in healthcare settings  and the  national  IPC  manual .If patient does not require admission for clinical reasons: advise self-isolation at home (based on assessment by the clinician and  following  UKHSA  guidance ).
