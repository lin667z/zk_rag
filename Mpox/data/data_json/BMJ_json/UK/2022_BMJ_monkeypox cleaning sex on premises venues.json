                "page_content": " Mpox is a rare viral infection, but recently there have been multiple cases in the UK and across the world. Mpox is mostly found in Central and West Africa. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. The overall risk to the UK population is low but the virus can spread between people through close physical contact including during sexual contact. Most recent cases have been in gay and bisexual men, therefore we are advising them in particular to be alert to any recent unexpected or unusual spots, ulcers or blisters and to contact a sexual health service or 111 if they have concerns. More  information on mpox is available ."

                "page_content": "Mpox can spread through close physical contact, such as kissing, skin-to-skin and sex. It is also possible that sharing items such as bedding and towels can pass the infection from one person to another. Cleaning to reduce risk from the environment in sex on premises settings can be effectively achieved without using specialist services or equipment. The risk of spread from surfaces can be substantially reduced by regular cleaning using standard cleaning and disinfection methods and materials, and by washing clothes, towels, linens or equipment with standard detergents and cleaning products. Staff performing cleaning and waste disposal should wear a fluid-repellent surgical mask, non-sterile disposable gloves, and a disposable apron. Hands should be cleaned before and after every clean using soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitiser can be used as an alternative to soap and water. Venues where sex occurs, especially group sex, such as saunas, dark rooms, and sex clubs, usually have standardised protocols for frequent cleaning of these spaces. Existing protocols for venue cleaning should be strengthened with additional measures: \\n   in addition to routine cleaning, areas should be frequently cleaned if soiled with semen, faeces, blood, urine or lubricant \\n   spot cleaning should be undertaken at least hourly (or more frequently if warranted during busy periods). Specialist cleaning is not required. Areas that should be targeted for cleaning include any surfaces that might be in contact with peopleâ€™s skin, such as benches, chairs, walls, beds and sofas \\n Waste such as tissues, condoms and paper towels should be double bagged and managed through standard waste management."
