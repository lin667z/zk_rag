The information is compiled from the Centers and Disease Control and Prevention and other sources \nand will be updated as more information and data become available.  Additional resources are available from \nthe IDSA Mpox webpage.   \nTable of Contents \n2022 Outbreak \nInfection Prevention and Control in Health Care Settings \nDiagnosis & Testing \nVaccination \nTreatment  \nIsolation and Prevention Measures for Patients \nGuidance for Key Populations  \nCoverage/Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Guidance  \nAcknowledgements \n2022 Outbreak \nThe  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking daily case rates for the U.S. by state and globally.  \nInternational data collected on people with mpox during the current outbreak indicate that 31% to 50% of \npeople with mpox had HIV. Mpox can be transmitted to anyone through close physical contact. The majority of \ncases in the U.S. and globally to date have occurred among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with \nmen and are suspected to have occurred through close physical and sexual contact. Based on the case data \nreported to the CDC, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals have been disproportionately \naffected by mpox in the U.S.  On Aug. 4, U.S. Department of Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra declared \nmpox a national public health emergency. CDC releases periodic technical reports on the mpox response that \ninclude the latest data and analysis of the current outbreak.  Given the low number of mpox cases in the U.S. \ntoday, HHS does not anticipate renewing the public health emergency past Jan. 31, 2023. \n \nInfection Prevention and Control in Health Care Settings  \nCDC has developed guidance for health care settings to prevent the spread of mpox that includes patient \nisolation, personal protective equipment, waste management and environmental infection control.  \nRecommendations include: \n \n• \nPlacing patients in a private room with a dedicated bathroom. Special air handling is not required.   \n• \nEnsuring health care workers wear a gown, gloves, eye protection and a NIOSH-approved particulate \nrespirator with N95 filters or higher.  \n• \nPerforming standard cleaning and disinfection using an EPA-registered hospital-grade disinfectant with \nan emerging viral pathogen claim. \n• \nHandling soiled laundry with standard procedures, avoiding contact with any lesion material. Laundry \nshould be gently contained in a bag without dispersing any infectious material.  \n• \nAvoiding dry dusting, sweeping or vacuuming in the room."

(See \nalso What to Do If You Suspect Mpox.) \n• \nHIV has been identified as a risk factor for severe manifestations of mpox. CDC recommends \nconducting HIV testing (including for acute HIV) for all patient with confirmed or suspected mpox in \naddition to testing for other STIs. \n• \nThe clinical presentation of Mpox during the current outbreak is different than the manifestations \nduring previous outbreaks.

State \nand commercial laboratory protocols and swab requirements vary. Check with your state health \ndepartment for its protocols.  \n• \nTesting conducted by health departments is available at no cost. Patients will be charged for testing \nconducted by the commercial laboratories and the fees will vary. For insured patients, their health \ninsurer will be billed, but they may be subject to their health plan’s cost sharing requirement. \nUninsured patients will be required to pay out of pocket for testing.  \nVaccination \n \nVaccines \n• \nCDC recommends vaccination be considered for anyone who may be at risk for mpox or might be \nexposed in the future. \n• \nBuilding Healthy Online Communities is maintaining a directory of mpox vaccine sites by zip code.  \n• \nThe preferred vaccine JYNNEOS is available from state and territorial health departments.   \n• \nJYNNEOS is a two-dose vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prevention of \nsmallpox and mpox. The FDA recommendation is for the two doses to be administered 28 days apart.  \n• \nThe JYNNEOS vaccine has been studied in people with HIV and people with AIDS (CD4 > 100 \ncells/mm3). Available data indicate the vaccine is safe for people with HIV and that people with HIV \ngenerated an immune response comparable to people without HIV. (See CDC HIV Mpox  guidance). \n• \nUnder the public health emergency declaration, FDA granted an emergency use authorization to allow \nfor intradermal administration of JYNNEOS with an injection volume of 0.1 mL for people 18 years and \nolder. (see CDC Interim JYNNEOS Guidance).  \n• \nACAM2000 is a one-dose vaccine that contains live virus. A greater supply of ACAM2000 is available \nthrough the Strategic National Stockpile. This vaccine may cause severe illness in people with HIV and \nother individuals who are immunocompromised.   \n• \nACAM2000 is a live virus vaccine and should not be given to people with HIV (see CDC HIV Mpox \nguidance). \n• \nThe CDC recommends against delaying mpox vaccination following COVID-19 vaccination.  \n• \nAfter mpox vaccination, a 4-week waiting period could be considered particularly for young men (ages \n12 to 39) before receiving a Moderna, Novavax, or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine because of the \nrisk for myocarditis and pericarditis. This also could be considered for the Moderna and Pfizer-\nBioNTech COVID-19 bivalent boosters.  \nAccess  \n• \nState and territorial health departments are determining the allocations and eligibility policies for \nvaccination within their state/jurisdiction. \n• \nFor states and jurisdictions using online or telephone registration programs, we recommend reserving \nappointments or vaccine doses for safety-net clinics serving populations at higher risk, including sexual \nand gender minorities, people of color, people with HIV and other populations at risk for severe illness."

It is uncertain whether treating mild disease in people who are not \nimmunocompromised is beneficial. \n• \nThe mpox virus may have a low barrier to developing resistance to tecovirimat; indiscriminate use \ncould promote resistance.  \n• \nAdjustments to treatment dosing and duration may be needed for people who are \nimmunocompromised. Clinical consultation is available from the CDC by calling (770) 488-7100 or send \nan email to eocevent482@cdc.gov. \n• \nThe AIDS Clinical Trials Group is conducting the Study of Tecovirimat for Human Mpox Virus (STOMP) \nClinical Trial (A5418) to evaluate the effectiveness of TPOXX.  See the STOMP website for trial \ninformation, including a list of participating clinical trial sites.  \n• \nTPOXX for treatment of mpox is only available through a CDC expanded access investigation new drug \nprotocol.1  \n• \nTPOXX can be requested through your state or territorial health department or by contacting the CDC \nEmergency Operations Center (770-488-7100; poxvirus@cdc.gov). Assistance from the CDC Operations \nCenter is available 24/7, including weekends.   \n• \nJurisdictions also can order TPOXX through HHS and pre-position treatment supplies at pharmacies to \nexpedite access.    \n• \nCDC and FDA allow for treatment to be started before the paperwork is submitted with the completion \nof an informed consent form (Spanish version) and before confirmatory testing results are available. \nState policies may vary.  \n• \nJurisdictions are encouraged to allow treating facilities to preposition a limited supply of TPOXX \ninventory to expedite access and prevent delays after hours or on weekends.   \n• \nTPOXX has been purchased by the federal government for the Strategic National Stockpile so it is \navailable at no charge to clinics, institutions and patients.  \n• \nSevere pain has been a common morbidity with this outbreak. Pain management should be prioritized \nas part of the treatment plan, and CDC has developed guidance for managing pain in patients with \nmpox.  \nConsiderations for Treating People With HIV From CDC:  \n• \nAccording to CDC data, 38% of people diagnosed with mpox during the current outbreak are co-\ninfected with HIV. \n• \nPatients with HIV who have low CD4 cell count or who are not on HIV treatment are at increased risk \nfor severe illness from mpox. \n• \nMedication, treatment and close monitoring are recommended for patients with HIV who are exposed \nto or suspected to have mpox.  \n• \nPatients with HIV on treatment for mpox should continue their antiretroviral treatment without \ninterruption. \n• \nPatients with HIV and mpox who are not on HIV treatment should initiate antiretroviral treatment as \nsoon as possible.
