However, people who are significantly immunocompromised, most commonly from advanced HIV (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count <200 cells/mm3 and especially <50 cells/mm3), have experienced more severe infections, including increased likelihood of hospitalization and disseminated disease, likely because their weakened immune systems are unable to clear the virus. Although they may have a higher risk of infection and severe illness, severe outcomes are not universally seen in people who are immunocompromised: one study from the 2003 outbreak of mpox in the United States noted recovery without severe disease in one patient with lupus nephritis and another patient with prior bone marrow transplant.1  A case series published in 2023 reported 11 cases of mpox among persons with solid organ transplantation, including 1 mpox-related death in the cohort. Despite noting a high burden of skin lesions and systemic symptoms, most resolved their infection within 30 days of treatment. It is important to note that differences in disease severity may also be affected by the route of transmission, host susceptibility, and the quantity of MPXV inoculated.2"

It is not known whether the prodromal phase of mpox differs between people who are immunocompromised and those who are immunocompetent. People who are immunocompromised may present with an atypical rash, including a disseminated rash, which may make diagnosis more challenging. In one study, people with poorly controlled HIV were more likely to have genital lesions and a confluent or partially confluent rash, as opposed to discrete lesions.9 Rash presentations in people who are immunocompromised can also have coalescing or necrotic lesions. Additionally, people in this study with poorly controlled HIV were more likely to have prolonged illness. See also Severe Mpox in Hospitalized Patients — United States, August 10–October 10, 2022 | MMWR (cdc.gov) and HAN 00475: Severe Manifestations of Mpox among People who are Immunocompromised Due to HIV or Other Conditions. Signs and symptoms In people who are immunocompromised, the signs and symptoms of mpox may be either similar (i.e., rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy) or dissimilar to those observed in people who are immunocompetent. In people who are immunocompromised, mpox may present with atypical manifestations or more severe illness (e.g., sepsis, disseminated rash, hemorrhagic disease, numerous confluent lesions, necrotic lesions, severe lymphadenopathy that can be obstructing, ocular or periorbital infections, pulmonary involvement, encephalitis, myocarditis or other conditions requiring hospitalization).12 For more information on severe disease caused by mpox see Severe Mpox in Hospitalized Patients — United States, August 10–October 10, 2022 | MMWR (cdc.gov) and HAN 00475: Severe Manifestations of Mpox among People who are Immunocompromised Due to HIV or Other Conditions. Differential diagnosis In people who are immunocompromised, mpox should be considered as a possible etiology of rash illness. Other etiologies to consider include herpes zoster (shingles), scabies, molluscum contagiosum, herpes simplex, enteroviral infection (hand-foot-and-mouth disease), syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and other infections which can cause cutaneous manifestations in immunocompromised hosts (e.g., endemic fungi, non-tuberculous mycobacteria), allergic skin rashes, and drug eruptions. Mpox can be confused with disseminated herpes zoster or herpes simplex virus infections. These herpes virus infections, and especially disseminated herpes zoster, most commonly affect people with immunocompromising conditions. Therefore, to establish a diagnosis for immunocompromised people who present with a rash, clinicians should elicit a medical history that includes a detailed sexual health history (i.e., partner number, frequency, activities), perform a complete physical examination, and order appropriate laboratory testing. Coinfections Mpox coinfections with STIs have been reported. In a September 2022 MMWR, among 1,969 people with mpox in eight U.S. jurisdictions, 38% had HIV infection, and 41% had an STI in the preceding year. Therefore, people being evaluated for mpox should also be tested, and treated as indicated, for HIV and other STIs.13, 14 Laboratory Confirmation For details on specimen collection and handling, please see Guidelines for Collecting and Handling Specimens for Mpox Testing."

For such patients, supportive care, pain management, skin care, and wound care that is implemented early in the course of illness is usually sufficient. However, prognosis depends on multiple factors, including initial health status, concurrent illnesses, previous vaccination history, and comorbidities. People who are severely immunocompromised from HIV (i.e., CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3) or other conditions or from immunosuppressive therapy may be at increased risk of protracted or life-threatening infection. Early optimization of immune function (e.g., by temporarily delaying or decreasing doses of chemotherapy and immunomodulatory therapies and by promptly initiating effective HIV antiretrovirals) is critical to favorable outcomes. Prompt initiation of tecovirimat (potentially the intravenous formulation), and possible combination with either cidofovir or brincidofovir, and VIGIV, should be considered in this population, depending on the severity of immunocompromise and uncontrolled viral replication. Decisions on whether and when to use medical countermeasures must be made individually for each person and can depend on a variety of clinical and other parameters.15The decision whether to treat and monitor a person who is immunocompromised in their home or in an inpatient setting should also be individualized. If the patient fails to improve with a usual course (i.e., 14 days) of oral tecovirimat, consideration may be given to both extending the duration of therapy, additional therapeutics, and changing the route of tecovirimat administration from oral to IV. Such considerations should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's condition, other comorbidities, ability to absorb oral medications, and ability to take a full, fatty meal. A March 3, 2023, MMWR provides updated clinical treatment considerations about using therapeutics to treat severe mpox cases, including ocular infections, neurologic complications, myopericarditis, complications associated with mucosal lesions, and complications from uncontrolled viral spread.  Keep Reading:\r\nClinical Care of Mpox In severe cases of mpox or for patients with mpox and immunocompromising conditions that put them at risk for developing severe disease, consider consultation with infectious disease, public health experts, or CDC.

Factors to consider include known high-risk exposure to a confirmed or probable case of infection and clinical conditions that necessitate an alternative option to PEP vaccination. Timing of vaccination Vaccines for PEP should not be delayed, regardless of whether patients are taking immunosuppressive therapies. Vaccinations administered prior to exposure to MPXV should ideally be timed taking into consideration current or planned immunosuppressive therapies, optimization of both the person's medical condition and anticipated response to vaccination, and individual benefits and risks. Ideally, orthopoxvirus vaccines should be administered at least 2 weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies when administered prior to exposure to MPXV. For patients who receive B-cell-depleting therapies on a continuing basis, vaccines should be administered approximately 4 weeks before the next scheduled therapy. The utility of serologic testing, cellular immune testing, or B-cell quantification to assess immune response to vaccination and guide clinical care has not been established. Such testing outside of the context of research studies is not recommended at this time. Vaccine safety and efficacy JYNNEOS JYNNEOS is a two-dose nonreplicating live virus vaccine.20 It is licensed by FDA for prevention of both smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. Because JYNNEOS is replication-deficient, it poses no risk for \nprogressive vaccinia\n\n\nautoinoculation (i.e., transfer of vaccinia virus from one part of the body to another)\n\n\ninoculation of others who come into contact with the vaccination site.\n\n\n Therefore, JYNNEOS can be administered to people who are in contact with household members who are immunocompromised. Available human data on JYNNEOS administered to people who are immunocompromised are insufficient to determine efficacy. JYNNEOS is considered safe for people with immunocompromising conditions; however, people who are immunocompromised may be less likely to mount an effective immune response after vaccination. There are limited data available regarding safety and efficacy of JYNNEOS in people who are immunocompromised except for studies regarding people with HIV. Specifically, one study enrolled people with a prior diagnosis of AIDS who were virologically suppressed and had CD4 counts between 100 and 500 and found no serious safety concerns; two doses produced neutralizing antibodies in 100% of people who were immunocompromised.21, 22 Studies regarding safety and efficacy of JYNNEOS in people who are immunocompromised are also limited. JYNNEOS was studied in an immunocompromised macaque animal model as a potential vaccine vector without any substantial safety concerns.23 Another study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of JYNNEOS in a small number of people with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant and found that JYNNEOS was safe and immunogenic in this population.24 Although an intradermal route of administration has been shown to be immunologically noninferior to a subcutaneous route in people who are immunocompetent, no data are available comparing safety and immunogenicity of these two routes in people who are immunocompromised. However, the risk for serious adverse events with either route is expected to be low. People who are immunocompromised may be vaccinated using either subcutaneous or intradermal route of administration. \r\nPackage Insert‎\r\nFor additional information, see the JYNNEOS package insert and the JYNNEOS Emergency Use Authorization.\r\n"
